            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That the Soul of Man is in its <hi>own Nature</hi> fitted for Immortality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of ſubſiſting and acting in a ſtate of ſeparation from the Body, and therefore deſigned thereto, is a Truth commonly acknowledged amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yea, and amongst Pagans too; as I have proved at large in a former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:64915:3"/>
            <p>It is therefore of great conſequence to underſtand in ſome competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Nature of the Heavenly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; becauſe the more clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct our Apprehenſions are in this Matter, the more will our Hearts be raiſed to deſire it, and our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours quickened in the purſuit of it, and the better we ſhall underſtand the way that leads to it.</p>
            <p>The abſolute neceſſity of Holineſs, in order to our everlaſting Happineſs, is rather <hi>confeſſed,</hi> than well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the generality of thoſe that bear the Chriſtian Name; and this not for want of ſutable Means and Helps in order to ſuch Knowledg, but for want of Hearts to uſe them, <hi>Prov. 17.16.</hi> Men's thoughts are otherwiſe taken up, and their carnal Minds are averſe from Conſiderations of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>That Holineſs is neceſſary, becauſe God hath commanded it, is a very great Truth, and nothing but the Truth, but yet it is not the <hi>whole</hi> Truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb facs="tcp:64915:4"/>For beſides this <hi>legal</hi> Neceſſity of it, there is alſo a <hi>natural</hi> Neceſſity in the caſe, it being as impoſſible in the nature of the thing that we ſhould be <hi>happy</hi> without being holy, as that a blind Man ſhould be delighted with Colours, or one that is deaf with Sounds and Harmony.</p>
            <p>And this will appear if we conſider what it is that muſt make a rational immortal Spirit compleatly bleſſed; namely, the enjoyment of the moſt holy, glorious, bleſſed God, whereunto an unholy Soul is utterly indiſpoſed, and diſaffected; and therefore cannot be happy till its Temper be altered, and made ſutable to the Object; that is, <hi>holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saints in Glory are taken up with God, admiring, loving, praiſing, and delighting in him as their chief Good, their only Soul-ſatisfying Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, and as infinitely and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably good in himſelf; and withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the moſt ſweet and refreſhing ſenſe of his Love to them, without
<pb facs="tcp:64915:4"/>any Clouds, Darkneſs, or Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now, this kind of Happineſs is no way ſutable to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of an unſanctified Heart, and how ſhould a Man be happy while his very Soul is averſe to, and at Enmity againſt that which alone can make him ſo?</p>
            <p>This is the woful caſe of the far greater part of the World, which loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls for our deepeſt Lamentations over it, and our utmoſt Endeavours to redreſs it.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I have thought meet to publiſh the following Diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have laboured to lay open our <hi>Way,</hi> and our <hi>End,</hi> beginning with the latter, according to the <hi>order of intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore firſt laid down a <hi>ſhort, plain, ſcriptural</hi> Account of that bleſſed State reſerved in Heaven for true Believers, and then proceeded to open the Nature of that great Work of Grace, whereby we muſt be <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:64915:5"/>wrought,</hi> or made meet for that State. Each of theſe gives Light to the other, the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> are ſo near a-kin that they differ rather in <hi>degree</hi> than in <hi>kind, Grace is Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry begun, Glory is Grace perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe things were well weighed, and compared together, the advantage would be very great every way. Give me leave to mention ſome few Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1.</hi> This would effectually put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorant Cavils of fooliſh Men, who complain that the ways of Holineſs are too ſtrict and preciſe for them. Did they but better know what the Bleſs'd Above are <hi>doing,</hi> and what they are <hi>enjoying,</hi> they would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee reaſon to conclude, that the greateſt Diligence and Care we can uſe is all little enough to ripen us for ſo <hi>holy,</hi> ſo <hi>glorious,</hi> ſo <hi>perfect</hi> a State.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:64915:5"/>
               <item>
                  <hi>2.</hi> It would certainly pull down the groundleſs Preſumptions of Self-deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hypocrites, who promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Heaven at laſt, tho they be utter Strangers to that <hi>vital Power</hi> of Religion, without which there's no coming thither. No wonder that Men who hope for they know not <hi>what</hi> hereafter, live they know not, or care not <hi>how</hi> while they are here: But, <hi>whatſoever a Man ſows, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> Gal. <hi>6.7.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3.</hi> This would alſo ſhew us what way and manner of religious Worſhip is like to be moſt acceptable to God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to our ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That which tends moſt to refine and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize our Hearts, and ſo to fit them for Heaven.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>4.</hi> And conſequently what ends we ought to propoſe to our ſelves in every religious Duty: Namely, that we may get as near unto God, and be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with him, as poſſibly we can, till we come to the State of full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Communion with him.</item>
               <pb facs="tcp:64915:6"/>
               <item>
                  <hi>5.</hi> And what need there is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace to elevate and raiſe our Hearts to ſuch high and holy things as theſe. Alas, what poor work ſhall we make with ſpiritual things if we be left to our ſelves!</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>6.</hi> This will greatly ſupport the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the difficulties of their preſent State and Work: Their ſpiritual Conflicts will ſoon be over, and Heaven will make amends for all. The end to which the diſpiſed ways of Holineſs lead, is unſpeakably glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Laſtly; if the beſt of us did more clearly apprehend and frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Bleſſedneſs of a future State, and the neceſſary Connexion or near Alliance between Holineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this would put Life into all our Motions and Tendencies Heaven-ward, and would give a moſt refreſhing reliſh and ſavour to all our Duties.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages would accrue to us from a right
<pb facs="tcp:64915:6"/>underſtanding of our <hi>way,</hi> and our <hi>end</hi> compared with each other. But I muſt not make too large a Preface to ſo ſmall a Book.</p>
            <p>Nor will I ſtay to apologize (as the manner of ſome is) for the Weakneſs and Imperfections of the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. Only I tell thee, I have ſtudied that both as to the <hi>Matter, Method,</hi> and <hi>Stile,</hi> it might be <hi>plain, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and profitable for the uſe of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Readers, not to gratify the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious wanton humors of thoſe who have itching Ears; but to edify ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt upright Hearts. I hope I can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay in ſome meaſure, that as to the applauſe of Men, <hi>deſii curare,</hi> I have done regarding it. <hi>VVith me it is a very ſmall Matter to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Man's Judgment, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>4.3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude; if thou wilt read deliberatly what I have written, and conſider it impartially, and carry it home to thine own Heart and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by that prudent Self-application
<pb facs="tcp:64915:7"/>which the nature of thy Caſe ſhall require, I hope thou wilt get real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it; and when thou haſt ſo done, forget not to pray for him,</p>

                  <p>The Dependance of the Words upon what goes before. Their <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Real</hi> Importance. The Point of Doctrine to be inſiſted upon. The Method wherein it is to be handled.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the foregoing Chapter we have an account of the many ſufferings, and dangers to which the Apoſtle himſelf, and his Fellow-labourers in the Work of the Goſpel were expoſed. Verſ. 8, 9. <hi>&amp;c. Troubled on every ſide,</hi> —<hi>perplexed,</hi> — <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,</hi> —<hi>caſt down,</hi> —<hi>Always bearing about in the Body the dying of the Lord Jeſus, i. e.</hi> by ſuffering for his ſake, and in conformity to him: As it follows verſ. 11. <hi>Alway delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, he tells us what it was that bore up their Spirits, and kept them from fainting under all theſe Preſſures, namely, a believing proſpect of future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereof Chriſt's Reſurrection was a certain Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64915:10"/>and Pledg, verſ. 13, 14. <hi>We alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak: Knowing that he which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Jeſus,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>For which cauſe we faint not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He then proceeds to make a Compariſon between their preſent Troubles, and the Joy that was ſet before them. As for the <hi>former,</hi> he ſpeaks as tho he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſcarce worth naming: but of the <hi>latter,</hi> as if no words could be found great enough to expreſs it. verſ. 17. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh for us a far more exceeding, and eternal w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>] one Hyperbole upon another, and yet all little enough to ſignify the deep ſenſe which he had of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent worth, and excellency of that weighty Glory concerning which he ſpeaks. Thus Rom. 8.18. <hi>For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed is us.</hi> This he did upon due deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eration, well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point, [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, expendo] as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome of the Ancients render it.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee whence it was that they fetch't their Supports amidſt all the conflicts and difficulties they met with in this World. What they look't or aimed at [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] viz. <hi>The things not ſeen, which are eternal,</hi> verſ. 18. This was the Prize they ran for; and which they expected at length to obtain.</p>
               <p>And now, that none might think that their hopes were wavering, uncertain or ill-grounded, he goes on in this Chapter, wherein the Text is, to declare how full and ſatisfying their Aſſurance was, in this matter, and why it was ſo.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>For we know that if our Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God,</hi> &amp;c. Note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ere, that Faith is a certain infallible ſort of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg [we know.] So Joh. 6.69. <hi>We believe, and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64915:10"/>
               <p>Nor were their <hi>Deſires</hi> after this bleſſed State leſs ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, than their Belief and Hopes were <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſteady.</hi> verſ. 2.3, 4. <hi>We groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven,</hi> —<hi>that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality might be ſwallowed up of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we are brought to the Text, in which the Apoſtle lays down ſome further grounds of this their Confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> They were wrought for the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory, and that by God himſelf: <hi>Who alſo had given unto them the earneſt of the Spirit,</hi> as it immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and therefore, (ſays he) <hi>we are always confident,</hi> verſ. 6. Again verſ. 8. <hi>We are confident, I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> q.d. We do not run as at uncertainties, nor fight as Men that beat the Air, but know whom we have truſted, and that he will not fail our truſt. This is the Faith we walk by at preſent, till we come to the World of immediate ſight and fruition. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>And now let us return to the words of the Text, and conſider more diſtinctly, both the literal and real importance of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now he that hath wrought us]</hi> i. e. <hi>made, formed,</hi> or <hi>fitted</hi> us. The word ſignifies to <hi>faſhion</hi> or. <hi>poliſh</hi> a thing which was <hi>rude</hi> or <hi>unſhapen</hi> before; and ſo 'tis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Septuagint, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.33. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the ſelf-ſame thing] viz.</hi> That bleſſed State in which <hi>Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life,</hi> whereof he had been ſpeaking juſt before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. or if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of thoſe deſires and groanings Heaven-ward which are wrought in the Souls of Believers, it comes all to a ſenſe; for none, but thoſe who are prepared for Heaven, do <hi>rightly</hi> and <hi>judiciouſly</hi> deſire it, as ſhall be ſhewn more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is God]</hi> even he that hath provided that Glory <hi>for us,</hi> verſ. 1. hath alſo fitted us <hi>for it.</hi> The Order and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the words is very remarkable; God is not the <hi>Subject,</hi> but the <hi>Predicate</hi> of this Propoſition. It is not thus expreſſed [now God hath wrought us for this] tho that had been true, but the ſame Truth is ſpoken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64915:11"/>with a more <hi>piercing Emphaſis</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as the words are here placed. <hi>He that hath wrought us,</hi> —<hi>is God, q. d.</hi> Would you know the reaſon of our Confidence, Hope, and earneſt Deſires after Heaven? Why, we are wrought for it. Do you ask how we came to be ſo, or who hath thus wrought us? 'Tis God that hath done it, who always acts like himſelf; therefore this work is divine, beſeeming its great Author, ſuch as none but he could effect, the Finger of God is plain in it, and for that reaſon we doubt not but the Iſſue will be anſwerably glorious and excellent. The ſame way of expreſſion ye have, Chap. 1.21. <hi>Now he which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>real</hi> importance of the words, the only remaining difficulty (if that be any) is what divine work the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of. In anſwer to this, I ſhall only take notice of the three following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are moſt <hi>full</hi> and <hi>comprehenſive</hi> in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) God as he is our <hi>Creator,</hi> and the <hi>God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> hath given us immortal Souls; furniſh'd with facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to prepare for a better Life. He hath made them pure, ſpiritual, noble, intellectual Subſtances, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> conſiſting of any contrary Principles, which by acting <hi>upon,</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> each other, might infer the diſſolution of the whole. Now, in that he has given the Soul ſuch a Nature, 'tis manifeſt that he deſigns it for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal State, becauſe he doth nothing in vain, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fits his Creatures for the reſpective ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he hath appointed them: And ſince both <hi>Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64915:11"/>that's here ſpoken of: So that to be wrought for this ſelf-ſame thing, muſt needs ſignify ſomething peculiar unto true Believers, for they only have a right to the Heavenly Glory: and beſides the Greek word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] ſeems not ſo naturally to ſignify the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of a Soul, as ſome ſubſequent work upon it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready created; to which it's natural eſſence is <hi>preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> not <hi>produced</hi> by it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the God of governing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling Grace, he hath opened the way to Heaven for us, and ſo deals with us upon Terms of Mercy and Compaſſion, in order to our recovery from that ſinful and miſerable ſtate, into which we had brought our ſelves. To this end the Eternal Son of God, in the fulneſs of time ſanctified a Portion of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and took it into union with the Divine, and in it fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, perfectly obeyed the Law, offered up himſelf a Sacrifice to ſatisfy Divine Juſtice, conquered Satan, Death, and Hell; died, aroſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and was glorified, that we might chearfully and believingly follow him. Thus Human Nature in the Perſon of our great Mediatour was wrought through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ariety of Labours and Sufferings, till it arrived to the higheſt Advancement; that from hence we might be aſſured how great things are intended for us, if we do not reject the Counſel of God againſt our ſelves. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32. He is gone before to prepare a place for us, and to take poſſeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Arms are ever open to receive returning Sinners; the more weary and heavy laden with the Burden of Sin, the fitter for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Office upon.

On his part all things are ready: what then remains but that we thankfully lay hold on this Tree of Life, and by Faith feed thereon, that we may live for ever?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As he is our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and the Applyer and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64915:12"/>Perfecter of all to fit us for Glory, he works in the Souls of his People thoſe holy Qualifications, Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Affections, whereby the Heavenly State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes con-natural and agreeable to them, or rather they to <hi>it.</hi> To live, and have a being in a furture State is <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>'TIS not to be thought ſtrange, that our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fall exceeding ſhort, and our Expreſſions yet ſhorter, when we come to diſcourſe concerning that Glory, which is within the Vail: Who can, at this diſtance, give any other than a very imperfect Account of that fulneſs of Joy, which is in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and thoſe everlaſting Pleaſures which are at his Right Hand. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.</p>

               <p>Tho it doth not yet <hi>(fully)</hi> appear what we ſhall be, yet <hi>in part it</hi> doth.

               <p>It ſeems plain from Scripture, (as alſo from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing) that the Heavenly Felicity conſiſts <hi>mainly</hi> in, or reſults from two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A perfect fitneſs for the enjoyment of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bleſſed God.</item>
                  <item>2. The actual enjoyment of him.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64915:14"/>
               <p>Theſe are moſt intimately eſſential to that bleſſed State, and therefore to be principally conſidered: Tho there are alſo certain <hi>adjuncts</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of this Bleſſedneſs, which muſt not be wholly paſſed by; but of theſe afterwards. We will begin with the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A perfect fitneſs for the enjoyment of God. The faculties of the Soul ſhall be refined, ſtrengthned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, repleniſh'd to the utmoſt of their Capacities, with fulneſs of Divine Grace, and therein confirmed, and ſettled paſt all danger of revolt or decay; and therefore compleatly fitted (ſubjectively) for Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Communion with the bleſſed God, their objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Happineſs, Portion, ALL. As <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> preſuppoſe <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> ſo the perfection of the <hi>former</hi> is neceſſary to that of the <hi>latter.</hi> The beſt of Men, while here below, have great remainders of ſinful Weakneſs, all their Graces are enfeebled by a contrary principle of Corruption dwelling in them. Hence it is, that the workings of their Souls towards God are ſo weak and languid, and the Joys of Communion with him ſo often interrupted and obſcured: But in Heaven it will not be ſo. There we ſhall have Strength without Weakneſs, Light without Darkneſs, Love without any remaining Averſion. And then 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we ſhall have Joy without Sorrow.</p>
               <p>I know that ſome are ignorant and vain enough to talk of a ſinleſs Perfection here on Earth: And once I met with one who had the Face to tell me, that (were it not for a little Paſſion) for ought he knew, he was perfect. I preſently ask'd him, whether he thought he loved God, as well as he ought to love him? This put him to a ſtand, or rather made him go back from his former Aſſertion. Alas, how little do ſuch Men know of their own Hearts, or of the Latitude and Extent of the Divine Law! Pſal. 119.96. <hi>Thy Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis very obſervable that the Scripture has recorded the imperfections of the People of God, even as to thoſe particulars wherein they were moſt eminent.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64915:15"/>Thus Numb. 12.3. <hi>The Man</hi> Moſes <hi>was very meek, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Men which were upon the Face of the Earth.</hi> Yet we read, Pſal. 106.33. That <hi>his Spirit was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, that he ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that for this reaſon he was not permitted to go into the promiſed Land, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.51, 52. I mention not, how that when his anger was hot, he broke the Tables of Stone, written with the Finger of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. becauſe 'tis likely that was done by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Divine Inſtinct, to ſhew that rebellious People how unworthy they were of ſo great a Bleſſing: And how well they themſelves deſerved to be broken in pieces, and utterly caſt off.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Job</hi> 'tis ſaid in general, Chap. 2.3. <hi>That there was none like him in the Earth, a perfect and upright Man,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly Jam. 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Job.</hi> And have we not heard of his Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too? <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. when he curſed his Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How renowned was <hi>Solomon</hi> for Wiſdom! Who yet committed great Folly in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in his Old Age, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.4, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>How remarkably forward and Zealous for Chriſt do we find <hi>Peter</hi> to have been upon many occaſions! yet pitifully baffled by two ſilly Maids one after another, to the denial of his Maſter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.69, 71.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how many ſtrong Ones have fallen, and been wounded, even in thoſe parts where their greateſt Strength lay. Is it not then the heighth of Madneſs (or Fanaticiſm) to talk of univerſal Sinleſs perfection on this ſide Heaven?</p>
               <p>Surely the moſt able experienc'd Chriſtians ſpeak at another rate. Phil. 3.12. <hi>Not as tho I had already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, either were already perfect.</hi> So 1 Joh. 1.8. <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if once we get ſafe to Heaven, we ſhall ſin no more: Grace will then be grown up to its full maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſhall never be weakened by any contrary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple more. <hi>There are the Spirits of juſt Men made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64915:15"/>perfect</hi> indeed. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. There are no complaints of dull <hi>Inactivity,</hi> and liſtleſsneſs to ſpiritual work. <hi>Paul</hi> is not there crying out (as he doth in that ſorrowful, yet comfortable Chapter. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) <hi>Me miſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m! O wretched Man that I am!</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The good that I would, I do not,</hi> — <hi>I am carnal, ſold under Sin,</hi> —<hi>Sin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me,</hi> —<hi>Evil is preſent with me,</hi> —&amp;c. No, no, there's no room for any of this <hi>there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All thoſe Clouds of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and Confuſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Minds are ſo over-ſhadowed in this preſent State, will then be quite diſſipated and gone.</p>
               <p>The remnants of our <hi>Diſaffection</hi> and Enmity againſt God, which are now the matter or occaſion of our moſt grievous and piercing Complaints, will then be perfectly maſtered, and wrought out.</p>
               <p>All theſe Diſtempers will be cured, which muſt needs cauſe ſo great a Pleaſure, as none can have a full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of but they who feel and poſſeſs it.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall we find in our ſelves a fulneſs of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Life,</hi> Strength, and Vigour; then ſhall we be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the glorious <hi>Light</hi> of a perfect Day; then ſhall we be perfectly reconciled to the <hi>Love</hi> of the only Soul-ſatisfying Object. No wonder that Sorrow and Sighing are over, when Sin and all the curſed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, which occaſioned them, are done away.</p>

Their Thoughts and Affections are taken up with other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; their Time and Strength are laid out in pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and caring for that Fleſh which they carry to and fro with them; and therefore they love the World as affording ſutable Proviſion for it: But the love of the Father is not in them. <hi>This their Way is their Folly; yet their Poſterity approve their Sayings.</hi> Pſal. 49.13.</p>
               <p>And now, judg ye, whether ſuch Perſons be fit for the Heavenly State or no, review the Deſcription which hath been given of it. What! Shall Men imagin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves meet for the Enjoyment of God, ſo long as they hate him, induſtriouſly exclude him from their Thought; avoid all Acquaintance with him, prefer the moſt empty Trifles before him, perſiſt in wilful Rebellion againſt him?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us enquire a little how the Nature of Man came to be ſo depraved and unfit for its Happineſs and End. Certain we are that from the beginning it was not ſo. <hi>God made Man upright:</hi> but he quickly loſt his Integrity, by with-drawing himſelf from his dear Dependance <hi>upon,</hi> and Subjection <hi>to</hi> his Maker; he would needs have his Concerns in his own Hands, and be at his own diſpoſal: Thus he ſought out many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, changed his ultimate End, fell from God to himſelf, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>came <hi>unholy</hi> and <hi>unhappy</hi> both at once;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64915:20"/>and was upon the very brink of the extremeſt Miſery, and paſt all hope of recovery, if Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs had not ſtept in to his Relief.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>by one Man Sin entered into the World:</hi> by this woful Apoſtacy human Nature became ſo corrupted; this it was that introduced thoſe wretched Diſtempers of Spirit, which make Men ſo unfit for Heaven, as ye have heard. Hence it is <hi>that by Nature we are Children of Wrath. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Our firſt Parents could not tranſmit to their Poſterity, that Holineſs and Purity of Nature, even that Holy Image of God which they had loſt themſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are eſtranged from God even from the Womb, <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin:</hi> And for that reaſon not fit for the Heavenly Glory, till we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a new Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> till we be <hi>wrought for this ſelf-ſame thing.</hi>

And then put the Queſtion to thy own Reaſon: What kind of preparation ſeems neceſſary to fit a Man for ſuch an Happineſs as this?

               <p>And now I proceed to the Point, in the following method.</p>

               </list>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, in general, you may obſerve as follows.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64915:21"/>
               <p n="1">I. This great change conſiſts in turning unto the <hi>LORD,</hi> from whom we have ſo deeply revolted. We fell from God in the Loins of our firſt Parents (as <hi>Levi</hi> payed Tithes in <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10.) We brought not original Righteouſneſs (but Natures exceedingly corrupted) into the World with us; and many <hi>actual</hi> Tranſgreſſions have proceeded from that Corruption, ſo that our Iniquity is become exceeding ſinful; therefore we muſt be deeply humbled for the Wickedneſs of our Hearts and Lives, and ſo return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord from whom we are fallen. Iſa. 55.7. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his way, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 1. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your doings:</hi> —<hi>ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do well:</hi> — <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the LORD.</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the death of the Wicked;</hi> — <hi>turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die.</hi> O Sirs, ye muſt turn, or die. All your Idols muſt be renounced, eſpecially carnal SELF, to which the reſt are ſubſervient. Whatever ſtands in <hi>Competition</hi> or <hi>Contrariety</hi> to God, ſo far as it doth ſo, muſt be rejected with the greateſt Abhorrence and Deteſtation, that you may cleave <hi>entirely</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that are far from God, ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 73.27. You muſt be brought near to him, or elſe you cannot poſſibly eſcape: none but he can ſatisfy the vaſt Deſires of your Souls; how then ſhould ye be happy while ye affect a diſtance from him: 'Tis a perfect Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhall be ſhewn in its proper place.</p>
               <p>All our <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> muſt be wrought upon, or influenced by this great Change.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Soul is naturally a <hi>vital active</hi> Subſtance, as appears by the Vigour and Sprightlineſs of its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yea the beſt Philoſophy ſuppoſeth that it is never out of action. But what then? Towards God 'tis <hi>unactive, ſtupid, dead.</hi> And therefore it muſt be <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by the ſame Power, which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10, 20. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.1, 4, 5, 6. Its
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64915:21"/>
                  <hi>vital</hi> Power muſt be further enlivened, by a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Divine Spiritual Life, that it may be enabled and inclined to move readily, ſtrongly, conſtantly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, <hi>from</hi> whom this Spiritual Life is derived, through Chriſt, and therefore it acts <hi>towards</hi> him, and terminates <hi>in</hi> him, the ſame way: Thus the active Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be ſanctified, <hi>that we may be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might,</hi> Epheſ. 6.10.</p>
               <p>Obſerve therefore, that this <hi>vital</hi> Faculty of the Soul is no leſs capable of being improved, corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſtrengthened by holy Habits, than either of the other two, viz. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> tho theſe are commonly moſt taken notice of; it is an eſſential Power or Virtue of the Soul, as well as they. It ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates them to action, and communicates Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to them <hi>(ad intra;)</hi> as it executes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Will, directed by the Underſtanding <hi>(ad extra:)</hi> The former ſort of theſe Acts lying deep and inward are leſs obſerved, (and by many ſcarce at all) the latter (viz. the <hi>Executive</hi> Acts) are more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Therefore this vital active Power muſt be wrought to an holy Vivacity or Livelineſs for God, that we may move towards him, and for him, <hi>readily,</hi> with Promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Quickneſs of Spirit: And not be Lazy or Liſtleſs <hi>to</hi> Duty; <hi>ſtrongly,</hi> with holy Fortitude and Vigour, and not be formal, lifeleſs, or indifferent <hi>in</hi> Duty. What a Shame is it that Men ſhould pretend to have Heaven in their Eye, and yet ſtand ſtill, or move ſo ſlowly, as if they cared not whether ever they got thither or no? <hi>conſtantly,</hi> with an holy Steadfaſtneſs, not diſcouraged by difficulties that ariſe in the way, not fainting, nor weary of well doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Soul is naturally an <hi>Intelligent</hi> Being, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enquiring after Truth, yea, and ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined ſo to do. All Men are deſirous of Knowledg, in one kind or other; ſome vehemently ſet upon it, and very induſtrious and eager in their Purſuits after it; they compaſs Sea and Land to attain it, and highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue themſelves upon it.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64915:22"/>
               <p>But then, as to the things of God, Matters of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eternal Conſequence, we are by. Nature not only ignorant of them, but ſtrangely blockiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to a right Acquaintance with them. We not only want the <hi>actual</hi> Knowledg of them, but alſo a due <hi>aptitude</hi> and <hi>fitneſs</hi> to know them: Hence you ſhall find many Perſons, who as to other Matters are very quick and apprehenſive, but in a perfect Miſt as to thoſe Truths wherein the Welfare of their Souls is more immediately concerned; yea, Multitudes there are, who have ſate ſo long under the Means of Knowledg, that it might juſtly be expected they ſhould be able to teach others but yet are themſelves ſo dull, that they have need to be taught again which be the <hi>firſt Principles of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God.</hi> Heb. 5.11, 12. Others there are, who have, indeed, a <hi>Form of Knowledg.</hi> Rom. 2.20. (and it may be a Form of Godlineſs too) but not the Power of it: Many ſuperficial Notions floating in their Imaginations, and not a little puff'd up with them Tho ſtill they know nothing as they ought to know Some Acquaintance they have with <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Signs,</hi> but are Strangers to the <hi>Things ſignified</hi> by them. They know not the truth as it is in Jeſus, to the putting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Old Man. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21, 22. They may ſeem to have learned a great deal <hi>extenſively,</hi> but <hi>intenſively</hi> they have learn'd nothing. The Articles of their profeſſed Creed, are not in their Faith, unleſs dreaming might paſs for believing. Iſa. 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed on Report?</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In ſeeing they ſee not; neither do they underſtand.</hi> Mat. 13.13.</p>
               <p>Thus the State of Unregeneracy is a State of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; even ſuch as might be felt, were they not paſt feeling too: They are not only in the Dark, but they are <hi>Darkneſs. Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. An impure Maſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated Darkneſs; as one expreſſes it.</p>
               <p>But when it pleaſeth God by the Power of his Grace to work ſavingly upon a Soul, he cauſeth his Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, irradiates the Underſtanding,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64915:22"/>and enables it to diſcern ſpiritual things in a ſpiritual manner. This is done by the ſpecial Illumination or powerful Demonſtration of the Spirit: This produceth new Apprehenſions of things. The Man ſees with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eyes, and knows to purpoſe what he only thought he knew before. The Lord hath given him <hi>an Heart to perceive, Deut.</hi> 29.4. he is now convinced that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the chitfeſt among ten Thouſand, — altogether lovely,</hi> Cant. 5.10, 16. Tho formerly he could ſee <hi>no Form nor Comlineſs in him.</hi> Iſa. 53.2. Now the Beauty of Holineſs appears, and he is even amazed at himſelf to think that he ſaw it no ſooner.</p>
               <p>Thus Divine Light breaks in upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Day-ſpring from an high viſits it, <hi>The new Man is renewed in Knowledg.</hi> Col. 3.10. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God is a <hi>rational intelligent</hi> Act, ſincere Religion moves not blindly. But that brings me to another Head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The main point in this great Change is yet behind, I mean the Sanctification of the <hi>Will:</hi> This is the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſtands it out the longeſt againſt God; being moſt wickedly averſe from him, and therefore hardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt brought to yield to the Importunities of his Grace. Ye <hi>will not come to me, that ye might have Life. How often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> Mat. 23.37. <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice: And</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis in this unwillingneſs that their Impotency doth mainly conſiſt, they cannot find in their Hearts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. O what deep Convictions, what Fears and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, what Pangs and Throws, what vehement Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings do ſome undergo before they yield! And ſome who never yield at all! Their faint Inclinations to that which is good, are over-powered by a more ſtrong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; thus the rebellious Will of Man ſtands it out againſt the Law and Grace of God. 'Tis a far eaſier matter to convince Men's Underſtandings, of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and neceſſity of turning to God, than to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64915:23"/>cure that Diſaffection and Enmity which is rooted in their Wills and Hearts againſt him. Therefore, I ſay, the main Work lies here, <hi>viz.</hi> In turning the bent of the Will, and putting it in a right poſture God-ward; determining our Reſolutions for him; <hi>powerfully</hi> and <hi>ſweetly</hi> enclining us to cloſe with him; drawing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conſtraining us with the Cords of a Man, the Bands of Love: working our Hearts to that temper whereof the Pſalmiſt's Words are very expreſſive, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>WHOM HAVE I IN HEAVEN but Thee?</hi> &amp;c. When this is done, then is the Heart of the Old Man broken, then the Soul ſtands no longer at ſuch an unkind diſtance from God as it did before. But being begotten of him, hath an ingenious Child-like Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards him. O my God, I can reſiſt no longer; thou art ſtronger than I, and haſt prevailed; thy Love hath overcome me, victorious Grace has got the day, <hi>Other Lords, beſides thee, have had Dominion over me: But by Thee only will I make mention of thy Name.</hi> Iſa. 26.13. Thus they cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> and feel at length how good it is <hi>to draw near to God.</hi> Pſal. 73.28.</p>
               <p>In this it is that true Grace, <hi>Holineſs,</hi> or <hi>real</hi> Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth principally conſiſt: Namely in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Will towards God; it is the giving our Hearts to him which before were moſt unreaſonably and wickedly alienated from him. 'Tis this which he doth eſpecially call for, inſiſt upon, and expect from us; this he ſets moſt by, and without it will not accept of any thing elſe that we can offer. Prov. 23.26. <hi>My Son, give me thine Heart.</hi> This <hi>is more than all whole Barnt-offerings and Sacrifices,</hi> Mark. 12.33. Thus the wandering Soul is brought back to its proper Center and Beſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis an honeſt Friendly good-natured Diſpoſition of Heart God-wards, always tempered with dutiful Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſo adorable a Majeſty; who needeth not ſuch poor ſilly Worms as we, <hi>but will be gracious to whom be will be gracious, and will ſhew Mercy on whom he will ſhew Mercy.</hi> Exod. 33.19. Thus the deſign of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64915:23"/>Goſpel is to bring us into <hi>Fellowſhip with God.</hi> 1 John 1.3. That henceforth we may converſe with him as our beſt and deareſt Friend. And confidently expect from him all that Kindneſs and Faithfulneſs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch a Relation; and what may we not hope for from ſuch a Friend, ſuch a Father? Nothing ſhall be wanting that's fit for him to give, or for us to receive. Luk. 19.31. <hi>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi> The Love of God to his People (as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) cannot be overſet, it knows no difficulties. The greater the Performance or Vouchſafement, the more ſutable to Divine Love.</p>
               <p>Again, this great Change is an opening of our Hearts towards God, which before were ſhy, reſerved, eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſhut up againſt him. Tho they were always his by <hi>Title,</hi> yet not till now by <hi>Conſent;</hi> before, he had <hi>(jus ad rem)</hi> a right <hi>to</hi> them; now, he hath <hi>(jus in re)</hi> an actual Intereſt <hi>in</hi> them, and Poſſeſſion of them. The Everlaſting Doors are now opened, and the King of Glory is entered in. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. Thus we give unto God the things that are God's.</p>
               <p>How ſhall I make it plainer? 'Tis a ſincere, deep, inward, hearty, prevailing Love to him, who is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> it ſelf. This is the Life and Subſtance of all true Religion, the fulfilling of the Law in one Word, <hi>LOVE.</hi> Without this thou haſt only the ſhadow of Holineſs, but <hi>really</hi> art nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, the Will is the firſt <hi>Subject</hi> of moral Good and Evil: 'Tis turned from God by Sin, yea and ſet againſt him. Grace reduceth and reconciles it to him again; ſo that the tendencies of the renewed Soul are towards God, that it may know him more, love and ſerve him better, be brought yet nearer to him; and more fully conformed to his Will. It deteſts all thoughts of Happineſs in which the Enjoyment of God is not included; or rather which is not wholly includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Enjoyment. <q>He ſays unto the Lord, Thou art my God, I cannot take up with any thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64915:24"/>elſe for my Portion and Supreme Good; my Soul panteth after thee, longeth for thee, and is even weary of it ſelf to find any Remnants of its old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from thee. Theſe are my daily Groans, O that I could aſcend more! Send forth, O Lord, thy powerful attractive Love, let that holy Flame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume my Droſs, that the nobler part may know in home, its reſt, its all. How precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O God, how great is the ſum of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I knew in ſome meaſure long ſince that none but God could make me compleatly happy, I have often heard of this by the hearing of the Ear, but now I know it better, mine Eye ſees it, I find and feel that my Soul is otherwiſe affected towards thee than i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Paſſage betwixt the Head and Heart is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, thus the Will is determined for God: And thoſe Truths which before only hovered in the Brain, or Imagination, ſink down, work into the very Soul, and attemper it to themſelves.</p>
               <p>I have been ſomewhat large upon this Head, but all's little enough to make unregenerate Perſons underſtand theſe things, tho ſtill they pretend to love God. But I proceed:</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſenſitive Paſſions or Affections muſt alſo be ſanctified, ſo as to fall in with the ſuperior Faculties (eſpecially the Will) and be ſubſervient to them, in order to the great Ends of Holineſs or Religion. That is, they muſt be devoted unto God, exerciſed upon him and for him. The rational and ſenſitive Appetite are ſo nearly connexed, at leaſt in this Life, that the Acts of the <hi>former</hi> (ſo far as we perceive them) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take in ſomewhat of the <hi>latter,</hi> and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſcribed accordingly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Paſſions of Affections are oft-times an <hi>occaſion,</hi> or <hi>means,</hi> to awaken and excite our <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to do their duty; and therefore of exceeding great uſe, if rightly managed and improved.</p>
               <p>And tho the great Work of Grace lies principally
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64915:24"/>in the higher Faculties of the Soul, as <hi>intellectual:</hi> Namely in the <hi>vital active Power, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>WILL:</hi> And muſt there be <hi>mainly</hi> ſought and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after. <hi>viz.</hi> Whether we have an high Eſtimation of God, and do reſolvedly and rationally cleave to him, endeavouring to act ſutably in our Lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, tho it muſt be granted that our Paſſions are not ſo apt to be moved by ſpiritual and inviſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as by ſenſible things that are near us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and withal, that <hi>they</hi> are many times ſtrongeſt, where Judgment is weakeſt, and very uncertain too, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much upon the Conſtitution of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, I muſt needs ſay, that thoſe Perſons whoſe Affections move ſenſibly and freely toward other things, but ſcarce ſtir at all as to the beſt and higheſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are certainly in a weak and languid State of Soul, if not quite dead.</p>
               <p>If we be indeed riſen with Chriſt; then, as we <hi>ought,</hi> ſo we <hi>ſhall,</hi> in ſome meaſure, <hi>ſet our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things above,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2. If the Will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominantly for God, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed but that the Affections will in ſome degree go along with it, and if they move but ſlowly, it will be matter of Grief, and will put us upon earneſt Strivings to raiſe them to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Frame.</p>
               <p>'Tis paſt doubt that true Grace tends in its own Nature to heal all the Diſeaſes of the Soul, to rectify all its Faculties and Powers, and ſo the Paſſions and Affections amongſt the reſt: That is, to take them off from wrong Objects, to moderate their Exceſſes, to turn them into a right Channel; nor are theſe tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies fruitleſs, the Effect is, in part accompliſht. So far as this great Change takes place and prevails in the Soul, the Affections of <hi>Love, Deſire, Joy, Delight, Hatred, Sorrow, Fear,</hi> and the reſt, will be moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their proper Objects and Ends. We ſhall hate and abhor what is diſpleaſing to God; mourn that we have ſo often offended; earneſtly deſire to be accepted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64915:25"/>with him; and to enjoy more of him, hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs. And therefore, we ſhall ſtrive to love God more ſeelingly, and ſo to rejoice and delight in him; and tho many Impediments and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ariſe in our way, yet ſtill Grace will be tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe things. And we are greatly wanting to our ſelves, if we do not daily endeavour to ſtir up the Grace of God that is in us, that all the Powers of our Souls may be quickened more and more in their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by it: If we ſtay till our Affections ſtir of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we may wait long enough. 'Tis our part <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> to concur <hi>with</hi> and <hi>by</hi> that gracious Help which is afforded us, in order to the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ckening and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizing of them, and bringing them more under the command of the Will, till at length they be accuſtom'd and inured to move more <hi>naturally, freely</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly</hi> Heaven-ward.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt we faint or be diſcouraged tho we find our Hearts ſluggiſh and averſe to ſuch work as this: We muſt perſiſt in duty notwithſtanding this Indiſpoſition. And wait for God's Help in his own way: Yea we muſt caſt our ſelves into his Arms, tho he may ſeem, as it were, to ſhut up himſelf from our Prayers, and to withhold the ſweet Influences of his Grace. It may be he withdraws to ſee how we will take it; ſhall we not lament (and follow ſo much the harder) after him? what tho we have not ſenſible Comfort, let us ſtay our ſelves on him; and <hi>againſt Hope believe in Hope.</hi> Rom. 4.18. Duties are ſweet when recovered out of the Hand of Temptations and Difficulties; we are bound, but God is free: What you want as to the <hi>ſeeling</hi> of Affection, make out in <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Reſolutions for God, and ye will get ground even while ye think ye loſe it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even the Body it ſelf muſt be ſanctified, that is, preſented or devoted unto God, and uſed for him. <hi>This is the Will of God, that every one of us poſſeſs his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in Sanctification.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.3, 4. <hi>That Sin reign not in our Mortal Body, but that we yield our Members as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64915:25"/>of Righteouſneſs unto God.</hi> Rom. 6.12, 13. <hi>Our Bodies are for the Lord,</hi> —<hi>they are Members of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6.13, 15. <hi>Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> verſ. 19. The Body muſt be uſed as a Servant to the Soul, and both employed in the Service of God. 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>Glorify God in your Body, and in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which are God's.</hi> 'Tis true indeed that bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe profiteth little, <hi>without</hi> or <hi>in compariſon</hi> of that which is ſpiritual. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. To bow the Knee, while our Spirits remain ſtubborn and unbroken. To lift up our Eyes Heaven-ward, if our Souls be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lifted up. To draw nigh to God with our Lips when our Hearts are far from him, is an Addition of Hypocriſy to all the reſt of our Iniquity. But on the other hand, 'tis as true that if our Souls be for God, our Bodies will be ſubſervient to them, and their Members accordingly uſed by them. The Eyes will be opened to behold the wonderful Diſcoveries which he hath made of himſelf in his Works, and in his Word: The Ears to hear the Inſtructions of Wiſdom: The Lips to praiſe and magnify Him, and by ſpiritual Diſcourſe to edify others, feed many, and miniſter Grace to the Hearers.</p>
               <p>Therefore, tho our Hearts muſt be firſt look'd at in the Service of God. Yet care muſt alſo be taken that our Words and Deportment be alſo ſutable and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; becauſe outward Worſhip is <hi>expreſſive</hi> of that which is inward, and reflects back again upon the Heart it ſelf: As Habits are ſtrengthened and increaſed by the Acts which flow from them; ſo are internal Affections by correſpondent Expreſſions and Behaviour in Duty. Tho we muſt not ſo cry up and magnify the Externals of Worſhip, as to overlook the inward Life and Soul of it, as Hypocrites who love to be ſeen of Men are wont to do. So on the other Hand, we ought not to pretend our good Meanings or Spirituality in Divine Worſhip, to excuſe us from befitting Geſtures or outward Demeanour therein: Nor muſt we be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to judg and cenſure others, as if they were meer
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64915:26"/>Ceremonious Hypocrires, becauſe they ſeem to put Religion into a more fine or formal dreſs, than we our ſelves have been uſed to. In ſhort, let us neither be <hi>rude</hi> nor <hi>antick</hi> in Matters of this Nature; but let the Frame of our Spirits, as alſo our Words and Geſtures be <hi>reverent, grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious,</hi> leſt we be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prophaning holy things. God is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the whole Man.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee that our <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea and our Bodies too muſt according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Capacities be all ſanctified and devoted unto God. Which is fully comprehended in thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, 1 Theſſ. 5.23. <hi>And the very God of Peace ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify you wholly: And I pray God your whole SPIRIT, and SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L, and BODY be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt Head, <hi>viz.</hi> That this great Change conſiſts in turning unto the Lord from whom we have ſo deeply revolted.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Since it is only in and through Jeſus Chriſt that God is reconcilable to fallen Man, 'tis highly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we have a due regard to him in this Matter.</p>
               <p>Joh. 14.6. <hi>No Man cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. of this Chapter, <hi>God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himſelf. Neither is there Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other. Acts</hi> 4.12. As God himſelf is our <hi>ultimate</hi> End, ſo Jeſus Chriſt is the principal means and way to bring us to that End. The Will of God is ſo fully declared in this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That we can have no acceſs to the Father but by the Son, that it would be inſolent daring Preſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ption for us to attempt it any other way. Never think of approaching the Preſence of God, tranſacting with him, preſenting your ſelves or ſervices to him, or of expecting any Favour from him, but <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through</hi> Chriſt. Joh. 5.23. <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent him.</hi> 'Tis therefore requiſite that we ſet an high value upon this great Mediatour, that we dearly love him, and ſincerely commit our ſelves

So we our ſelves, and all our Sacrifices muſt be offered unto God the ſame way: That is, we muſt aſcend unto him by the ſame <hi>Medium</hi> through which he deſcends to us: or elſe no acceptance is to be look'd for. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.

               <p>Not as if the Father was of himſelf averſe to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Compaſſion, but only prevail'd upon, and as it were over-perſwaded thereto by the Death-Merits and Interceſſion of his Son.

               <p>But to come to the point: 'tis certain, the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is wrought by degrees; and as God hath appointed a courſe of Means to be uſed, Duties to be performed in order to our Converſion, and Salvation: So he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords the help of his Grace in various Meaſures, as ſeems meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o his Infinite Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thus there are ſome <hi>commoner</hi> Operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which uſually go along with the Goſpel, and put Men into a <hi>nearer</hi> preparation, for <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace than they were in before. Tho' God may ſometimes, even in an inſtant, convert the moſt unprepared obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons; yet it is not his ordinary Metho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo to do, nor have any ſuch Perſons reaſon to expect to be thus dealt with.</p>
               <p>As the Word is the Inſtrument by which God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon Souls, ſo he firſt enables them in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to underſtand it, and then to believe it, and ſo by it he awakes them from their ſtupid Security; convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them of the Sinfulneſs, and Danger of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate State: Makes them ſolicitous about their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Welfare. <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> How ſhall I eſcape the Damnation of Hell? Thus they are brought to ſee their need of Chriſt, as Men that are loſt and undone without him: As alſo to perceive the neceſſity of Holineſs in order to Happineſs: Hereupon they make ſome Reſolutions and fair Promiſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put forth ſome ſeemingly hopeful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to become new Men: Inſomuch that they are almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians indeed; and are not far from the Kingdom of God: Tho' they muſt be brought yet nearer, or elſe they are loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>Now tho' all this fall ſhort of a through Change, yet it hath a <hi>preparatory</hi> tendency thereto. Somewhat of this kind <hi>ordinarily</hi> goes before the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Therefore ſuch Impreſſions are not to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis dangerous to ſmother Convictions, by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64915:29"/>the noiſe, and hurry of the worldly Buſineſs, or ſenſual Delights, to divert our Thoughts from theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Special ſaving Grace determines the Soul to a ſincere and hearty cloſure with God in Chriſt. Here is the turning point; this it is to which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd preparations tend: And in which they muſt iſſue, and terminate to make us Chriſtians indeed: 'Till this be done, the Perſon is in a carnal unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State. We turn not unto God as God, if we turn not to him as the chief Good; and we turn not to him as the chief Good, ſo long as we prefer any other Object or Intereſt before him.

Our Eye muſt be ſingly fix'd upon God, as our Supream End and chief Good; and ſo it will be full of Light; and our Hearts muſt be accordingly affected towards him. <hi>A double Mind,</hi> a Heart and a Heart, (as 'tis in the Hebrew, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2.) <hi>is hateful in the ſight of God.

               <p>Behold here, and admire the wonderful Wiſdom that appears in the contrivance of our Redemption: Our Sin had brought us under the juſt Wrath and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Almighty: And alſo had corrupted our very Vitals, and turned our Hearts againſt God.

                  </hi> Life (no leſs than the <hi>Natural</hi>) depends upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual influx of its Almighty Author. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our Being;</hi> not only as <hi>Men,</hi> but as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or new Men. The Strength of that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace ſubjected <hi>in</hi> us, would never hold our, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daily Influences of efficient Grace ſtill working <hi>upon</hi> us. Thus we <hi>are kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. And <hi>preſerved unto his Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.18.</p>
               <p>We know what woful work our firſt Parents made, when their Concerns were left in their own Hands; how ſhamefully they betray'd their Truſt, and ruined at once themſelves, and their Poſterity; and this through the meer mutability of their Nature, tho' upright, and innocent, as it came out of God's Hand. What then might be expected from us, who have not only mutable Natures, but great Remnants of Sin and Corruption, even in the very beſt of us. Surely if our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64915:30"/>ſtock of Grace were left only to our own management, we ſhould ſoon turn Bankrupts.</p>
               <p>Let it be conſidered, that Grace is not a <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Principle; not <hi>eſſential,</hi> but an <hi>additional</hi> to our Beings; not born with us, but as it were a ſtranger, or new comer in us: And that our Hearts are not wholly diſpoſſeſſed of thoſe Objects which are againſt its work, nor delivered from thoſe Principles which have an enmity to it: Yea, that we often loſe ſome degrees of it, and therefore ſhould quickly loſe the reſt, if the divine Power were not engaged in our Preſervation, and that Faithfulneſs which <hi>will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. This holy Seed would ſoon come to nothing in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly a Soil as our Hearts are, were it not cheriſh'd and watered by the ſame Hand that placed it there. This Spark of Divine Light would quickly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, if not kept in, and refreſhed, by continual Emanations from the Father of Lights.</p>
               <p>'Tis true we are commanded to <hi>keep our Hearts with all diligence,</hi> [or above all keeping] <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. To ſtand upon our guard, to be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable. That is, we muſt put forth our utmoſt Endeavours, (for God works by means) but if we <hi>truſt to our Hearts, we are Fools,</hi> Prov. 28.26. I may allude to that Pſal. 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the Watch-man waketh but in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, we muſt do our utmoſt <hi>to keep that good thing that is committed to us;</hi> but how? By the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>the Holy-Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.14. So Jude 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the Love of God.</hi> But then <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25. He teacheth them to look higher than their own Endeavours in this matter. <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling;</hi> — <hi>To the only wiſe God our Saviour, be Glory, and Majeſty, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Power, both now, and ever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> By the ſame Almighty Power, the new Creature is carried on <hi>gradually</hi> towards its deſigned Perfection. Phil. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64915:31"/>that he which hath begun a good work in you, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> [or finiſh] <hi>it, until the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> of Grace is not only kept whole in the Soul, but more abundant Life given it: According to the deſign of its merciful Saviour. Joh. 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have Life, and that they might have it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly.</hi> That Heavenly <hi>Light</hi> which hath ſhined in upon it, increaſeth <hi>more and more unto a perfect Day.</hi> Prov. 4.18. The principle of holy <hi>LOVE</hi> is cheriſh'd, and blown up, till at length it come to a pure and perfect Flame.</p>
               <p>That which hath been already wrought is good, ſo far as it goes; but the bleſſed Author of it will not leave his work imperfect; it ſhall be all <hi>very good,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has done with it. As at the firſt Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. God intends for his Children not only a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>parts,</hi> but of <hi>degrees:</hi> And in ſo doing, he deals with them according to the manifeſt Tendency of that divine Nature, whereof he hath made them Partakers.</p>
               <p>Can any thing be more agreeable, than for thoſe who have taſted that the Lord is gracious, to deſire more full, and ſatisfying reliſhes of his Grace? And has he given them thoſe Deſires to abuſe, and torment them? It cannot be. Surely thoſe that <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, ſhall be filled.</hi> Mat. 5.6. Yea by how much the greater their Longings are, ſo much the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for large Communications. Pſal. 81.10. <hi>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Ask great things, and with earneſt Deſires, and ye ſhall receive, that your Joy may be full.</p>
               <p>This leaves a black Note upon thoſe who are at a ſtand in Matters of Religion; make no progreſs, but ſeem well enough content with the meaſures to which they have attained. I tell you, ſuch Perſons have great reaſon to ſuſpect their own Sincerity; nay, if this be their <hi>ſtated, conſtant, habitual</hi> Temper, they may juſtly be pronounced Hypocrites. He that thinks he hath Grace enough, has certainly no true ſaving
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64915:31"/>Grace at all. <hi>Living Natures,</hi> as Plants, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thrive till they come to Perfection. Pieces of <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>dead</hi> Things, as the Image of a Child, a withered Plant, are at a ſtand, or grow worſe. Phil. 3.14. <hi>I preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mark. Sincerae ſanctitatis inſe parabile ſignum eſt. deſiderium ſincerum perfectionis. Method. Theol. part</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 216. A ſincere Deſire of Perfection, is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Sign of ſincere Holineſs.</p>
               <p>Is it to be thought that that Man has any ſaving Knowledg of God, or ſincere hearty Love to him, who doth not deſire to know him better, and to love him more? Ye that have experienc'd what theſe things mean, <hi>conſider of</hi> it, <hi>take advice,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak your Minds.</hi> But as for empty lifeleſs Hypocrites, I except againſt them, they are not competent Judges in the Caſe: Becauſe they ſavour not the things of the Spirit, but have their Judgments bribed, and over-ſwayed, by the Fleſhly Intereſt.</p>
               <p>We are expreſsly commanded <hi>to grow in Grace, to be always abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> And it muſt needs be of ill Signification, as to our State, if ſuch commands weigh nothing with us.</p>
               <p>But with the truly Godly it is not ſo; the Grace which they have already received, inclines them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after more, tho' ſtill it is God that worketh in them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and Laſtly. The Souls of Believers are at their death made perfect in Holineſs. Somewhat hath been ſpoken of this already, which is now to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrated and proved. The Scripture aſſures us, that the Souls of the Godly, being ſeparated from their Bodies, do paſs into Glory, or into the Preſence of Chriſt, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom.</hi> Thus our Lord tells the Penitent Thief, Luk. 23.43. <hi>To Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> So the Apoſtle in this Context, <hi>We are willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> verſ. 8. We are alſo told, that the Angels ſhall be our Convoys to bring us thither. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. Now 'tis certain, that no unclean thing, nothing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64915:32"/>that defileth can enter into the heavenly ſtate. From whence it follows, that the Souls of the Faithful ſhall then be perfectly freed from all ſinful Weakneſſes; and therefore muſt need: be perfectly holy: For 'tis Non-ſenſe to ſuppoſe a middle ſtate in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in a rational Creature, obliged by the Law of its Nature, to a perfect conformity to the Will of its Creaton. But what needs further reaſoning, when we are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told of the <hi>Spirits of juſt Men-made perfect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus 'tis evident, that when Death hath opened the Womb of Time, or drawn aſide the Vail, and let us into Eternity; all our ſinful Imperfections will be leſt behind us; and never trouble us more. How weak ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our preſent Inſant-ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e on Earth is; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above but perfect Holineſs, and Love. Thus the Day of Death is the Birth-day of the gracious Soul's Perfection. This is our third Birth (as one ſpeaks) and therefore no wonder if there be ſome Pangs, and Difficulties in it: As there was in the Birth of <hi>Nature,</hi> and in that of <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo in this of <hi>Glory.</hi> Should not the thoughts of this make Death welcome? It may be you will ſay, Death is an Enemy to Nature. But is it not a conquered Enemy? Has not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even in our Nature overcome it? Has he not taken away the <hi>ſting</hi> of it? And in ſo doing, gained us the <hi>victory.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wiſdom of our mighty Redeemer, this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Death,</hi> is turned to our advantage; <hi>To die is gain.</hi> Is in terrible to Nature? What is Faith for, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſuch Fears? Muſt we not die in Faith, as well as live by is?</p>
               <p>But to return to the Point.</p>
               <p>'Tis no wonder if ſuch ſinful imperfect Creatures as we, be much at a loſs in our apprehenſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a State of Sin leſs Perfection, both as to the <hi>nature</hi> of it, and the <hi>manner</hi> how 'tis brought about: But for all this, it is not hard to conceive, that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things which may greatly contribute thereto. I will juſt name three Particulars,</p>

               <p>Thus we have conſidered the ſeveral Steps, whereby the work of Grace is begun, and carried on till it come to Perfection.</p>
               <p>I would only add, that in this whole Buſineſs no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is done to our natural Faculties: Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth Nature, which it heals, and rectifies, but doth not deſtroy; tho' the workings of the Spirit in this matter be <hi>powerful,</hi> and <hi>efficacious,</hi> yet they are alſo <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>agreeable.</hi> They will act moſt freely, when made free by Grace; 'tis ſo determin'd, that it alſo determines it ſelf; that is, it moves <hi>ſpontaneouſly</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, or, having received the influx of his Grace, <hi>actively</hi> concurs therewith, <hi>viz.</hi> Being firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated, and quickened thereby.

Is it not plain from theſe Scriptures, that there is ſuch a thing as Election of particular Perſons to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: And that as God doth decree to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life upon certain conditions, ſo he doth alſo decree to give thoſe conditions to certain Perſons: And the execution of the Decree is ever anſwerable to the Decree it ſelf? Epheſ. 1.11. <hi>Being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will.</hi> Deny this, and you may deny any thing.

               <p>Is not eternal Life the Gift of God, and has he not told us the way in which he hath determin'd to give it, and is it not downright madneſs to expect it out of God's way?</p>
               <p>If therefore you be ſollicitous concerning your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Welfare, do not take the prepoſterous courſe of thoſe Perſons, who beginning at the wrong end firſt, amuſe themſelves about the eternal Decrees of God; remember <hi>ſecret</hi> things belong to him, <hi>revealed</hi> to you; therefore turn your Thoughts inward, examin whether you have been effectually called, ſo as to conſent to the holy Covenant, and if ſo, ye may comſortably conclude concerning your Election. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>

And well may it be ſo called by way of <hi>eminency,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe greater meaſures of Grace are given under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, than were uſual before.</p>
               <p>Now, the ſacred Office of the Miniſtry is inſtitured in ſubſerviency to the Influences and Operations of the holy Spirit. 'Tis he that qualifies Miniſters for their work, aſſiſts them in it, and makes it ſucceſsful to the attainment of its end. Moreover, the Sum and Subſtance of that Errand, upon which we are ſent, ye have in the latter end of this Chapter. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20. Namely to tell you, <hi>that God was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the World unto himſelf,</hi> — <hi>hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our buſineſs therefore is to treat with Sinners in the Name of God, and the Redeemer: That we may perſwade them to comply with the offers of Free Grace. And to edify, ſtrengthen, and help the Joys of thoſe who have heartily complied. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>And O how ſtrict a charge is laid upon us! That we <hi>be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon;</hi> reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine. <hi>For the time will come when, &amp;c.</hi> (we may <hi>now</hi> ſay 'tis already come) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4.

               <p>Well then; if Men may be ſaved without being wrought for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of what uſe is the miniſterial Office? Or why are we ſo ſtrictly charged?</p>
               <p>Moreover, the whole Courſe of Rellgious Duty that is appointed us, with that Seriouſneſs and Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64915:36"/>therein required, doth fully prove the Point we have in hand: The holy reverent Worſhip of God in his Ordinances, doth powerfully tend to raiſe our Souls nearer to him, and to make them more like him; to heal our ſpiritual Diſtempers, and to refine and purify all our Faculties and Powers, and ſo to prepare and ſit us for the State of Heavenly Perfection. Therefore we muſt not look upon ſuch appointments, as if they were only <hi>meer arbitrary</hi> Injunctions, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act homage from us: But (tho' Soveraign Authority is to be acknowledged in them) we muſt alſo conſider how infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs has ſured out <hi>Work</hi> to our <hi>End,</hi> our <hi>preſent</hi> Duty to our <hi>future</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that by the one we might be prepared for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. From whence 'tis evident, that Holineſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Work and Buſineſs of our preſent Life, as alſo to our future Bleſſedneſs. We can neither ſerve nor enjoy God here or hereafter, without being wrought thereto by his Grace. I mention nor the heartleſs Service of Hypocrites, as not being worth taking notice of. Hence alſo ye may learn what ends to propoſe to your ſelves in every part of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But I proceed,</p>

Ye cannot produce the leaſt Syllable in Scripture, whereupon to ground thoſe hopes of Heaven, wherewith ſuch Men are wont to flatter themſelves. But I can ſhew you enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and overthrow their wicked Preſumptions for ever. The Sentence of their Condemnation is legible in almoſt every Leaf of the Bible; yet will they not conſider it, nor lay it to Heart. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already; he ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.

               <p>Know therefore, that the holy Spirit of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Souls of Believers, ſutable Inclinations Heaven-ward, and Deſires after it, (that is, rational, judicious, holy Deſires) doth thereby give them an earneſt of it; but ſtill remember, <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8, 9.</p>

               <p>Thus ye have heard how the Saints <hi>now</hi> in Glory got thither; and will ye dream of coming to Heaven any other way? They were all wrought for that bleſſed State, and ſo muſt ye; or elſe fall ſhort of it, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Well Sirs, Do ye think much to be told of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that lie in the way to Heaven? Are ye for a <hi>cheap, formal, cuſtomary, eaſy</hi> way of Religion? Do ye think that the greateſt Earneſtneſs, Care and Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we can poſſibly uſe to ſecure our Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Intereſt, is making more adoe than needs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Look ye to it, go on and proſper; but remember, that the <hi>Righteous themſelves are ſcarcely ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly, 'Tis impoſſible, in the very nature of the thing, that an unholy Soul ſhould enjoy the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Felicity. This is evident, if ye will but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Temper and Spirit of unregenerate Perſons, with the Account that has been given concerning the State of future Glory. The nature of Things muſt be quite overthrown, and the groſſeſt Contradictions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, before an unrenewed Perſon, as ſuch, can be happy.</p>
               <p>I know that all Men have ſome general <hi>injudicious</hi> Tendencies (even by Nature) towards Happineſs: But as for thoſe upon whom this great Change has not paſt, they neither <hi>know,</hi> nor truly <hi>deſire</hi> that which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64915:38"/>alone can make them bleſſed. They are moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confounded in their own Wiſhes, and cannot tell what they would be at. They ſay indeed that they deſire, and hope for Heaven; but in the mean time they know not what they talk of. Were it poſſible they ſhould be admitted thither; why, ſo long as their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt depraved temper of Spirit remaineth upon them, they would be quite out of their Element, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py even in Heaven it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is plain; there muſt be a ſutableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Faculties and the Objects, or elſe what Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what Pleaſure can there be?

               <p>As for the <hi>Society,</hi> 'tis holy, there's a Communion of Saints in Perfection: But the Hearts of carnal Men are impure, and unholy: There are none like them to converſe with in Heaven.</p>

                  <p>Several Inferences of Truth drawn from the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus we have fully proved, that except ye will be <hi>holy,</hi> ye cannot be <hi>happy:</hi> If this therefore be ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> a Truth, it muſt needs be alſo a very <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>important</hi> one: a thing much to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and cloſely applied; becauſe our Spiritual and Eternal Welfare, and (what is infinitely more than either) the Glory of the Great God is <hi>ſo</hi> nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
               <p>Now ſince there are many other Truths, which have an intimate connexion with, and dependance <hi>upon</hi> this great Doctrine; let us begin with the Conſideration of theſe, for the informing of our Judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſer.</hi> 1. We may learn from hence the great Worth and Excellency of real Holineſs. Real (I ſay) in oppoſition to that <hi>vain, empty ſhew</hi> of Religion, wherewith Multitudes make a ſhift to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; even becauſe they know no better, and that becauſe they will not know. Satan hath taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64915:40"/>by their own Corruption to blind their Minds, and cloſe their Eyes; and thus, <hi>they chooſe Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> Hence it is that they <hi>ſee no Beauty in Holineſs;</hi> no more than they do <hi>the Form and Comlineſs of the great Pattern and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of it.</hi> Iſa. 53.2.</p>
               <p>They do not <hi>approve things that are excellent.</hi> If they meddle with Matters of Religion, they do but debaſe them: Firſt by forming low and unworthy Notions of them, ſutable to their own degenerate Tempers and Spirits; then they act accordingly; and after all highly value themſelves upon what they have done.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the high Excellency of Holineſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appears from the <hi>three</hi> following Particulars which may eaſily be drawn from what has been already delivered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its Original. 'Tis from Heaven, the bleſſed God is himſelf the Author of it, as in the Text. <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing is God.</hi> 'Tis a Divine Work, and that not a <hi>common</hi> Work neither, but wrought in a way of <hi>ſpecial Grace;</hi> and therefore it has a <hi>peculiar</hi> Excellency in it. Inſomuch that the Subjects of this great Change are denominated, <hi>born of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. <hi>born from above,</hi> chap. 33. as the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] may be rendred. Hereupon they are advanced to the Name and Relation of Children: 1 Joh. 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> So called, and not miſcalled, for ſo they <hi>are,</hi> as verſ. 2. <hi>Now are we the Sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Nature of true Holineſs ſpeaks the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it. 'Tis the Soul's Conformity to the bleſſed God; his Image drawn upon it, a Participiation of the Divine Nature: which ſweetly and effectually inclines all the Faculties and Powers of our Souls God-ward; and ſo far as it prevails upon us, it takes away our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Averſion and Eſtrangedneſs from him, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to center upon him, as our Portion, Happineſs, and chief <hi>Good.</hi> In ſhort it is our devotedneſs unto
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64915:40"/>God, which implies a Separation from whatſoever; ſtands in oppoſition againſt him, as ſuch.</p>
               <p>So that had the Apoſtle been ſilent as to the Author of this great Work, the very Nature of it might have told us whence it is, for it bears the Image and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of God upon it.</p>
               <p>Little do the proud Deſpiſers of Holineſs conſider what they ſay, or <hi>againſt whom it is that they ſprit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make a wide Mouth, and draw out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Iſa. 57.4. To vilify this work is a diſhonour to its Author. To caſt Dirt upon the <hi>Image, is</hi> an affront to its great <hi>Original, who ſcorneth their Scorners, ſits in the Heavens, and laughs at them, for he ſeeth that their Day is coming,</hi> Pſal. 37 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The bleſſed End and Iſſue of Holineſs ſhews you the worth of it; it comes from above, and thither it leads; and is at laſt compleated in the Heavenly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Judg then of the Way and Means by the End; here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints. They are high-born, and a ſutable Inheritance is deſigned them. To think or ſpeak ſlightly of Holineſs, is to contemn Heaven it ſelf; which is a State of Perfection <hi>therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wo unto them that draw Iniquity with Cords of Vanity, and Sin as it were with a Cart-Rope. That put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs.</hi> Iſa 5.18, 20. It may be at laſt they'll ſay (as one of their Predeceſſors did) <hi>let me die the Death of the Righteous:</hi> Not from any love to Righteouſneſs, but from a ſlaviſh Fear of the juſt Puniſhment of their Impiety; and therefore thoſe <hi>forced</hi> Cries will avail them nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſer.</hi> 2. Learn from hence the Reaſonableneſs and Equity, yea, the wonderful Grace and Benignity of the Divine Government over fall'n Man! See what a Connexion there is between our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi> All the <hi>Precepts</hi> which God hath given us, may juſtly he eſteemed as ſo many <hi>Directions</hi> which have a <hi>natural</hi> Tendency to our own Welfare.

They cry up the <hi>natural</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Man's Will, but conſider not its <hi>moral</hi> Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency or Indiſpoſition to that which is God; it's cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Averſion from God and Holineſs, which will never be overcome but by the Power of Free Grace. I know indeed that if Men were truly willing, then the work were done, and therefore the Obſtinacy of their Wills makes them inexcuſable. John 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have Life.</hi> But I alſo know, <hi>that if ever they be made willing, it muſt be in the Day of God's Power.</hi> Pſal. 110.3. <hi>No Man can come to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64915:45"/>me, except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> That is, their Wills are ſo corrupt, that they cannot find in their Hearts to renounce their Luſts, and give up themſelves to the obedience of the Goſpel. <hi>They affect a diſtance from God,</hi> care not for coming near him: They are <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho ſtill they have <hi>natural</hi> Faculties, intellective and elective Powers, (elſe we might as well preach to Walls as Men) yet when all's done, 'tis Grace that muſt ſanctify and heal theſe Faculties, and determine them <hi>God-ward,</hi> or elſe they are loſt for ever. That ſome are thus wrought upon is plain Matter of Fact, ye need go no further then the Text for Proof thereof. And 'tis as plain that others are left under the Power of their own willful Enmity, and Alienation from God. In ſhort, that <hi>any</hi> are ſanctified and ſaved is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> that the <hi>reſt</hi> periſh is their <hi>own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not ſtrictly and properly becauſe they <hi>could not,</hi> but becauſe they <hi>would not</hi> do otherwiſe. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which falls upon them is of their own chuſing in that they will not be perſwaded to forſake the way that leads to it. Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul: All they that hate me, love Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of Grace is eſtabliſh'd, <hi>ordered in all things, and ſure.</hi> The Terms of Salvation are unalterably ſettled, and God will judg Men accordingly, without reſpect of Perſons; and ſo ſhall the Sentence of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be executed too.</p>
               <p>Moreover, God gives unto all Men ſuch degrees of Grace and Help, as is meet for him to give; and more by far than they duly improve. And if they would rightly uſe what they have (ſo far as they are able) they have great encouragement to expect more; therefore his proceedings with them, for their will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglects, are beyond all juſt exception.</p>
               <p>Again; if over and above all this, he give to ſome Perſons (as 'tis certain he doth) yet <hi>greater</hi> Proportions of Grace, even ſo much as ſhall effectually work upon

               <p>What ſay ye? Are not ſome Perſons ſaved? Are they not ſaved by Grace? Is not this Grace the Gift of God? Doth God give it in <hi>time,</hi> and did he not decree to give it from <hi>Eternity?</hi> Where then are your Cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Election and ſpecial Grace? Surely you will not deny but that Multitudes periſh by their own wilful final Impenitency, <hi>through the Righteous Judgment of God, becauſe they hated him, and would not that he ſhould reign over them.</hi>

               <p>Ye have heard it fully proved, that there is a great work which muſt be <hi>done</hi> upon your Souls, or ye are <hi>undone</hi> for ever: And dare ye neglect the offered Help of the Spirit? Do ye not yet know that by a <hi>commoner</hi> ſort of Grace, he uſually prepares Men for <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace? And can ye expect the <hi>latter,</hi> while ye deſpiſe or improve not the <hi>former?</hi> Do ye not conſider that ſuch neglects are like to leave you under greater Guilt and Hardneſs than ye were before? Why then do ye delay to ſtrike in, and comply with the inward Motions of the Spirit? Why do ye not pray earneſtly for more of his help? Do ye not ſometimes feel ſome awakening Convictions, ſome Deſires, ſome Purpoſes which have atendency toward your Converſion? Whence are theſe but from the bleſſed Spirit of God? And when he calls, will ye behave your ſelves as if ye heard nor, or were not at leiſure to regard him? How will ye be able to anſwer this at laſt? How comes it to paſs, that ye put off things of this nature with ſome <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and then return to your wonted Coldneſs, and Formality, or Indifferency again? Have ye no where thus to trifle but upon the brink of Everlaſting Ruin? Know ye not that the Flames of Hell are every
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64915:46"/>Moment ready to catch hold upon you? Surely it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to ſtir as for your Lives: Do ye not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think how dreadful your Caſe would be, if the bleſſed God ſhould ſwear in his Wrath that his holy Spirit (whom ye have ſo often affronted and grieved) ſhould ſtrive no more with you? How can you read without Terrour ſuch Paſſages as theſe in Scripture, Prov. 1.24, <hi>&amp;c. Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh.</hi> —<hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer.</hi> Ezek. 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I haave purged thee,</hi> (that is uſed Means in order to thy Reformation) <hi>and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy Filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my Fury, to reſt upon thee.</hi> Rev. 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſay again, 'tis no time to trifle, unleſs ye be prepared to undergo the Fury of the Almighty, who will certainly revenge the Injuries which have been done to his Patience and Long-ſuffering.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64915:47"/>themſelves: But as for the <hi>looſe Generality,</hi> and <hi>formal empty Profeſſors,</hi> which make up far the greater Number, 'tis likely ſome of them might take it as an Affront to have their Hopes of Heaven called in queſtion: How common an Aſſeveration is it <hi>[as I hope to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved!]</hi> O Sirs, if Salvation was as common as the hopes of it are, we would no more ſay that the <hi>Gate is ſtrait,</hi> or <hi>the Way narrow,</hi> but rather that they are wide indeed: Nor would we ſay few find it, but few miſs it.</p>
               <p>'Tis the ſaying of a great Divine, — <q>For my own part if I had but one Sermon to preach while I lived, I think this ſhould be it, to perſwade down all your ungrounded hopes of Heaven; not to leave you there in Deſpair, but that ye may hope upon better Grounds, which will never deceive you. [Mr. <bibl>

               <p>I have ſhewed you already how common it is for Men thus to abuſe themſelves with preſumptuous hopes of Heaven: Give me leave alſo to tell you how <hi>vain, ſinful, dangerous,</hi> and how <hi>unnatural</hi> it is ſo to do: And by conſequence how juſtly ſuch Perſons deſerve to be reproved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis a vain thing for Men <hi>thus</hi> to deceive, and befool themſelves. Their hopes of Salvation are lying Vanities, if we conſider,</p>
               <p>Either the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Duration</hi> of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to their Nature. They are meer Creatures of their own Imagination (and yet deſerve not to be called <hi>entia rationis</hi> neither, for they are moſt highly irrational) empty Appearances, having no ſolid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in them, no firm Foundation to ſtand upon, Sparks of their own kindling. How fitly are ſuch hopes compared to a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> Job 8.13, 14. The Men are aſleep in Sin, and lo, theſe are their Dreams! Or if ye will, they are diſtracted, not yet come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. And theſe are the ravings of their diſtemper'd Imaginations: And all that Comfort which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64915:48"/>they get by them is no better than Deluſion, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture: They put a Cheat upon themſelves, and hate to be told of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe hopes are vain as to their Duration, Job 20.5. <hi>The Triumphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a Moment. His Hope ſhall periſh.</hi> And as it is compared to the Spider's houſe [for ſo it is in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:] So 'tis ſaid in the next words, <hi>he ſhall lean upon his Houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand; he ſhall hold it faſt, but it ſhall not endure,</hi> Job 8.14, 15. The hopes of the Ungodly meet with frequent Interruptions in this Life; Fears, Doubts; and miſgiving Thoughts do often diſturb them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of their carnal Security: The Approaches of Death ſhake them yet more. But however, the firſt Moment of their entrance into Eternity puts an end to their fooliſh Preſumptions for ever. Job 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite when God takes away his Soul?</hi> Chap. 11.20. <hi>The Eyes of the Wicked ſhall fail, and they ſhall not eſcape, and their Hopes ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> Chap. 18.5. <hi>The Light of the Wicked ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e put out, and the Spark of his Fire ſhall not ſhine.</hi> Thus ye ſee they truſt in Vanity, feed upon Wind, and lie down in Sorrow at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their hopes are ſinful. There is a great deal of Impiety and Wickedneſs in them. All the Attributes of God are affronted, and in ſome ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſuch groundleſs Preſumptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe impious hopes are utterly inconſiſtent with thoſe Apprehenſions which we ought to have concerning the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of the Divine Nature. <hi>He is glorious in HOLINESS; the Fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, he is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity: He hateth the workers thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To imagine therefore that impure unrenewed Souls, ſhould be admitted into the bleſſed Preſence of God, and partake of the heavenly Joys, without being firſt wrought and prepared for it by ſanctifying Grace: To ſuppoſe this, I ſay, would be to deny the Divine Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64915:48"/>or to obſcure the Luſtre and Glory of it: Yea, and to think that God is <hi>altogether ſuch an one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Pſal. 50.21. O Sirs, were ye but duly ſenſible of his infinite Purity <hi>in whoſe ſight the Heavens are not clean,</hi> Job 15.15. it would make you cry out, <hi>Who can ſtand before this HOLY Lord God! Or to abhor your ſelves, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> as a far better Man did, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. Or with the Evangelical Prophet to cry our, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone; becauſe I am a Man of unclean Lips,</hi> —<hi>for mine Eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 6.5. This would quickly drive you unto Chriſt, that under the ſhadow of his Wings ye might be ſafe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Truth of God is diſowned and contradicted by theſe daring Preſumptions. How great a matter doth God make of his Veracity: Pſal. 138.2. <hi>I will praiſe thy Name for</hi>—<hi>thy Truth, for thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> But, O what light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count do theſe Self-deceivers make thereof! tho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more earneſtly, frequently and plainly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Scripture, than the neceſſity of Holineſs to fit Men for Heaven: Tho they are told that the Flock of Chriſt is but a little Flock; and that few find the way that leads to Life: And that the Workers of Iniquity ſhall be doomed to depart from the bleſſed Preſence of God for ever: Yet they go on in carnal Security, and hope ſtill, as if all theſe Warnings were but idle Tales: Thus they impute Falſhood to the God of Truth, <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Liar,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10. Can there be more <hi>horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> then this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The inflexible Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God are contemned and ſlighted by ſuch Perſons. Shall not the Judg of all the Earth do right? Will he juſtify the Wicked? No, no; they that do ſo, <hi>are an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him,</hi> Prov. 17.15. Tho he be <hi>merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet he will by no means clean the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. It is a Righteous thing with him to recompenſe Vengeance to the Ungodly, and in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64915:49"/>ſo doing, he vindicates his own <hi>Holineſs, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Government. God that is holy, ſhall be ſanctified in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 5.16. Has he made Laws ſo juſt and good, and will he not keep up the honour of them, and ſee that they be duly executed? He needs not rule the World by Deceit, his Threatnings, as well as his Promiſes, are true; and the <hi>final</hi> Judgment will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convince the World that ſo it is. The Law which he has given us, is <hi>a Rule to live by, and to be judged by.</hi> Therefore as 'tis juſt, ſo 'tis certain, that the impious Hopes of wicked Men will be baffled and diſappointed at laſt.</p>
               <p>I might add, that the Patience, Goodneſs and Long-ſuffering of God are deſpiſed by ſuch Perſons, who wilfully continue in Sin, and yet think to eſcape his righteous Judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such groundleſs Hopes are exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to themſelves and others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To themſelves, as might eaſily be proved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Particulars; I will mention only two.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Hereby they are hardened in their impenitent unregenerate State. Theſe blind Preſumptions are ſo many ſtrong holds of Satan in their Souls, whereby he keeps Poſſeſſion of them. As I may, at leaſt allude to that, Luke 11.21. <hi>When a ſtrong Man armed keepeth his palace, his Goods are in peace.</hi> A falſe Peace indeed, maintained and cheriſhed by the Father of Lies, who is all the while carrying on his Deſign againſt them is the Dark, and when the Vail is drawn aſide, will readily let them know that they have loſt, and he has got the Game. Thus he blinds their Minds, and makes ſport with them, (as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did with <hi>Samſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> when they had put out his Eyes) leads them Captive at his will.
<p>Theſe vain Hopes hinder the due Efficacy of the Means of Grace upon them: Tho we tell them of their Danger over and over, with never ſo much plainneſs, yet they fooliſhly conceit that their Caſe is ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: And this puts a ſtop to their further Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64915:49"/>and ſo we are forc'd to leave them where we found them, or worſe; flattering themſelves, either that they are regenerate already, or elſe that they may be ſaved without ſo much ado. Thoſe Convictions of the Sinfulneſs and Miſery of their preſent State, which ſhould help to prepare them for Chriſt, are by this Means prevented. Mat. 9.12. <hi>They that be whole, need not a Phyſician, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it was with the Scribes and Phariſees; Are we blind alſo? Hence our Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us <hi>that Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before ſuch,</hi> Mat. 21.31, 32. <hi>viz.</hi> as being more likely to be brought to Conviction and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than thoſe Self-conceited Pretenders were. Iſa. 44.20. <hi>Hefeedeth on Aſhes; a deceived Heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his Soul, nor ſay, is there not a Lie in my Right Hand?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2.) This unhappy Preſumption makes their final Ruin more dreadful and amazing when it comes, Mat. 7.26, 27. <hi>He that heareth theſe Sayings of mine, and doth them not, ſhall be likened unto a Fooliſh Man, which built his Houſe upon the Sand: And the Rain deſcended,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> A great fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when a Man who in his <hi>expectations</hi> was as high as Heaven, ſhall in <hi>reality</hi> find himſelf as low as Hell. This muſt needs be an aſtoniſhing Diſappointment: And ſo much the more, becauſe the Matter will then be paſt redreſs: O with what Anguiſh and Bitterneſs will they then cry out! Alas, are all our hopes of Heaven come to this! how will Conſcience wrack and torment them for having ſlighted all the Warnings which were given them? How will the great Deceiver triumph and inſult over them, when they are paſt hope and help for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Tho the Deſtruction of all wicked Men will be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet that of Self-deceiving Hypocrites will be moſt ſurprizing, becauſe leaſt expected. Iſa. 33.14. <hi>The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid; Fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? Who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64915:50"/>or with the Burnings of Eternity, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] 1 Theſſ. 5.3. <hi>For when they ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety; then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then will they find to their endleſs Confuſion, that there is no Peace to the wicked; tho before they would never be perſwaded to believe it; they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſound Doctrine, it was too ſtrict for them, they had itching Ears, Iſa. 30.10. <hi>Speak unto us ſmooth things.</hi> But their Righteous Judg will not flatter them. The Flames of Hell will confute their Folly. Lo this is the Portion of them who forget God; thus ſhall their hopes fall and riſe no more. So dangerous are their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are alſo dangerous to others, who fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> hence take encouragement to cheriſh the like ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Hopes. Thus they mutually harden one another againſt God, as if they had made a Covenant with Death, and an Agreement with Hell. <hi>For they have made Lies their Refuge, and under Falſhood have they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Iſa. 28.15. As Noiſe and Company puts great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Boldneſs into Armies, than there is in ſingle Perſon alone; ſo is it here. As if God would ſpare them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Multitudes, tho his Holineſs. Truth, and Juſtice are engaged to the contrary. How ſhould ſuch Men proſper? <hi>Job.</hi> 9.4. Why, ſay they, we take no greater liberty, nor hope better for our ſelves, that our Neighbours do: What, ſhall none be ſaved but; a few ſtrict preciſe Perſons, who pretend to greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Diligence than all about them? God forbid. Thus they go on.</p>
               <p>But ſtay a little, and conſider the matter as you go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ye be in the wrong, it is not your following a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude therein that will ſerve to excuſe you. Have ye never read that Chriſt expects his Diſciples ſhould do more than others? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. And that he hath choſen them <hi>out</hi> of the World, and therefore they are not <hi>of</hi> it, nor muſt be conformed <hi>to</hi> it?

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64915:50"/>in how many things they fall ſhort of their Duty; and leaſt prone to flatter themſelves with preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hopes. And are ye they that ſhall eſcape in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly. It is very unnatural thus to ſooth up your ſelves with vain Hopes. The Principle of Self preſervation is moſt deeply implanted in human Nature, and accordingly is wont to take place in all other Caſes but this, where yet there is moſt need of it. If your <hi>Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, Reputations,</hi> &amp;c. were in danger, how thankful would ye be to any that would warn you of that Danger, and help you to avoid it? But while your Souls are expoſed to the utmoſt hazard, ye cannot endure to be told the truth of the caſe. <hi>They hate him that reproveth in the Gate!</hi> And thus they play about the ſides of the Pit, and ſo drop in one after another, without ſo much as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly whither they are going, (as Flies about the Flame of a Candle, till it catch hold upon them) O more than brutiſh Stupidity! Is it not enough that Satan will do his worſt to deceive you, but muſt ye alſo favour the Deceit, and take part with your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt your ſelves? While your Friends ſtand by and pitty you, but cannot help you, becauſe ye are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have your own way.</p>
               <p>Were not your Underſtandings made to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Truth? Is it not <hi>natural</hi> to them ſo to do? Why then do ye keep them in an <hi>affected</hi> Ignorance of thoſe things for which they were principally given you? And all this, while the Light ſhines round about you, tho ye cloſe your Eyes againſt it; and that in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of everlaſting conſequence, even the One thing needful. It is not neceſſary that you be richer or greater in the World, more honoured or reſpected by others; or that ye fare more deliciouſly than your Neighbours: But 'tis highly neceſſary that your Peace be made with God through Chriſt, and the Diſeaſes of your Souls healed by the Grace of the Spirit, or elſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64915:51"/>you are ruined for ever to all Intents and Purpoſes. How unnatural a thing is it to lay out your ſelves ſo earneſtly in providing for the Fleſh, while the better part, even the immortal Soul, is betrayed, ſtarved and undone.</p>
               <p>Have ye not been told already, that your fooliſh Preſumptions cannot be ſupported, except the very nature of things be overturned? Becauſe Holineſs is <hi>eſſentially</hi> included in the true Happineſs of the rational Creature: And therefore to expect the one, without the other, is to ſeparate a thing from it ſelf: As if a Man ſhould put out his own Eyes that he might ſee more clearly: Would not this be very natural think ye?</p>
               <p>Ye ſee then how vain, ſinful, dangerous and unn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural it is, thus to abuſe your ſelves. I have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Particulars <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> tho indeed they cannot <hi>really</hi> be <hi>divided,</hi> being moſt intimately connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and involved one in the Nature of another; for Vanity in a reaſonable Creature is ſinful: If idle Words muſt be accounted for, to be ſure idle Hopes will not paſs free. Again, that which is ſinful muſt needs be dangerous, nor doth any thing elſe deſerve to be called dangerous but Sin; for 'tis this that puts a Sting into all Dangers whatſoever: But <hi>he that walks uprightly, walks ſurely.</hi> And then again, to run wilfully upon ſo much Vanity, Sin, and Danger, is certainly unnatural, if Self-Deſtruction deſerve to be ſo called. And ſo it appears, how greatly thoſe Perſons are to be reproved, who thus cheat and impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will be ready enough to ſay, That this is ſtrange kind of Doctrine, and that it is like, 1. To drive Men to Deſpair. And ſo, 2. to diſtract them. And then at laſt, 3. to break their Hearts. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may perhaps be <hi>ſtrange</hi> to you, (and ſo much the more is the pity, that ye ſhould be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with your Bibles:) But 'tis not the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64915:51"/>leſs <hi>true</hi> for all that. As for the reſt of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ye ought not to deſpair of finding Mercy with God through Chriſt upon Goſpel-Terms: The infinite Goodneſs of God, and the ſufficiency of Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction are not to be doubted of; as great Sinners as you have been pardoned: And many alſo have periſh'd who never ſinned at the rate that ye have done. Take that along with you; as the former Conſideration may keep you from ſinful <hi>Deſpair,</hi> let the latter keep you from <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me therefore tell you withal, that you ought to deſpair of being ſaved in any other way, but what God had appointed. He is <hi>merciful</hi> indeed, but he is alſo <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>true; Except ye repent ye ſhall periſh. The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell. If ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall die,</hi> &amp;c. Do not think that God will falſify his Word, to juſtify your Preſumptions: Will ye ſlight his Mercy, and then complain of him as unmerciful?</p>
               <p>As to the 2d. Have not ſuch Perſons the plain Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Diſtraction upon them already? Are they not laying violent Hands upon themſelves? How can they be madder than they are, and yet they muſt not be told of it for fear of diſtracting or diſturbing them! That is, we muſt not uſe our Endeavours to bring them to their Wits again.</p>
               <p>As for the Third. <hi>The Sacrifice of God is a broken Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51. Your Hearts muſt be broken, that is, throughly humbled for your paſt Folly, in order to your future Reformation. You muſt be weary and heavy laden under a Senſe of your Sins, that Chriſt may give you reſt; broken, that he may heal you. <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician.</hi>

                  <hi>Motive</hi> 6. Think well, how ſad and wretched a caſe it is to be utterly in the dark as to your ſpiritual State. Ye cannot tell <hi>what a Day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27.1. For ought ye know ye may be in Hell the next hour; becauſe ye are uncertain whether God be your Friend or your Enemy; whether ye have any ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt; whether ye be ſanctified by the Spirit, or not. Is not this a woful Caſe, when thou lieſt down, when thou riſeſt up, when thou goeſt out or comeſt in, thou knoweſt not but that the very next Moment the divine Fury may reſt upon thee! Can'ſt thou think of Death, and not tremble, and of Judgment, and not be aſtoniſh'd? When thou art invited to a Funeral, how can'ſt thou forbear thinking, that it will quickly be thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wn Caſe? and yet thou art ignorant what will become of thy immortal Soul at that Day: Methinks this ſhould make thee a Terrour to thy ſelf, and to all that are about thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 7. Conſider how impatient thou art of being in ſuſpence, or at uncertainty in Matters of far leſs conſequence. If thou have but a Law-Suit in Hand, how uneaſy till thou know the Iſſue; if a Purchaſe to make, how careful to ſee that the Title be good, and the Conveyances firm and ſure: If thou be taken with any threatning Diſtemper, how earneſt and ſollicitous art thou to know what the Phyſician thinks of thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. Pray Sir, What think you? Did you ever ſee any in ſuch a Caſe before? Did they recover? Do you hope the Diſtemper may go off? But O, how few are there that expreſs any ſuch Care about their Souls! how few that will come to a Miniſter and enquire of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64915:55"/>him, O Sir! <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> I fear I am not yet wrought for Heaven, I find my Heart dead to ſpiritual Things, but vigorous and ſprightly in its Purſuits after worldly Vanities; I find I am out of my Element, when engaged in Religious Duties: What think you? Is there any Hope? O help me ſpeedily; leſt Death overtake me unprepared for it! O how ſeldom do we meet with any that ſhew ſuch a concern for their Souls as this?</p>
               <p>It were eaſy to heap up many more ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe, to excite you to this neceſſary work of <hi>Self-Reflection:</hi> I ſhall only add as follows, without the Formality of making diſtinct Heads.</p>
               <p>Think with your ſelves, how <hi>common</hi> a thing it is for men to be miſtaken about their ſpiritual Eſtate; and withal how <hi>dangerous</hi> it is; remember, God himſelf will quickly judg you, and the way to eſcape the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Judgment is to enter into Judgment with your ſelves. 1 Cor. 11.31. <hi>If we would judg ourſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, either ye <hi>are</hi> thus wrought for Heaven by renewing Grace, or <hi>not.</hi> If ye be, the cloſeſt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>al will greatly refreſh and comfort you, by diſcovering that the work is already done: Then may ye comfortably go on with the remaining part of Duty, which is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; ye may come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, as Children to a Father: Ye may read or hear the VVord of God with Joy, when the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel are all your own: Ye may come with Confidence to the Lord's Table, when ye know that <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> and <hi>all his ſaving Benefits</hi> are yours: Ye may meditate delightfully upon the heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, when ye know that ye have a right to it. This will ſupport you under all the Sufferings of the preſent Life, and will make them appear <hi>light Afflictions</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: And beſides all this, it will much conduce to the credit of your Profeſſion, by enabling you to go on chearfully in the ways of Religion; as Men that do not repent of their Choice, not deſpair of their Cauſe or of their God.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:64915:55"/>
               <p>But on the other hand, if ye be unregenerate; Self-Reflection is one of the firſt Steps in order to your Recovery. Pſal. 119.59. <hi>I thought on my Ways, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies.</hi> So did the Prodigal when he came to himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. When once Men begin to be ſollicitous about the Concerns of their Souls, and to enquire, What have we done? What are we doing? Whither are we going? How ſhall we eſcape the Wrath to come? This looks hopefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; tho ye muſt not ſtop here neither, nor take up with <hi>Convictions</hi> inſtead of <hi>Converſion.</hi> However, think not that your Wounds are like to be cured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſearched.</p>
               <p>But if through a ſtupid unconcernedneſs as to the Affairs of your Souls, ye think it not worth the while to give your ſelves all this trouble, tho in the mean time, ye are eagerly ſet upon this preſent World, (as the common Caſe is) I can then tell you what your Caſe is, without any further enquiry; ye may ſpare the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſearching whether ye be regenerate or no; for to deal plainly with you, 'tis certain ye are not.

               <p>
                  <hi>But yet a ſtep there is;</hi> your caſe is not quite <hi>deſperate,</hi> tho it be very <hi>dangerous:</hi> I muſt ſay of you, as of thoſe Patients whoſe Condition ſeems very hazardous, the Event is uncertain; but while their's Life their's Hope.

               <p>Even ſo is here; ſome have been converted and ſaved, who were once as dead and ſtupid about the Concerns of their Souls as ye are: But many to one have been loſt for ever. Therefore to flatter you in ſuch a condition, might contribute much to your ruin, which I am not willing to do.</p>
               <p>Therefore I tell you, there is juſt <hi>ſo much</hi> hope of

But here remember, that ſuch a miſtake may prove your ruin: 'Tis neceſſary ye know the worſt of your caſe while there is yet hope of redreſs. Ye have already heard what Multitudes there are that periſh by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: To think <hi>falſly</hi> that ye are in the way to Heaven will never bring you thither; nor will it cure the Diſeaſes of your Souls, to ſuppoſe that ye are well enough already; ſuch Ravings are a ſad Symptom that your nobleſt Faculties are impaired and diſtracted, and therefore that your Diſtempers are ſo much the more

               </p>
               <p>On the other Hand, ſome are ſo <hi>timerous</hi> and <hi>dejected</hi> in ſpirit, that they know not how to believe any thing that is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> concerning themſelves: So far are they from preſumptious Self-Conceit, that they run into a quite contrary <hi>extream;</hi> and ſtanding in their own Light, cannot diſcern the Evidences of their Sincerity. Fain they would be aſſured that their Hearts are right with God, but have not <hi>ſtrength of Spirit</hi> enough to conclude that it is ſo, through meer Fear, leſt it ſhould prove otherwiſe: They vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>wiſh</hi> it, but cannot perſwade themſelves to <hi>believe</hi> it; ſtill thinking 'tis too good News to be true. Like Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they told him <hi>that Joſeph was alive, his Heart fainted, for he believed them not,</hi> Gen. 45.26. or as the poor Jews, <hi>when the Lord turned again the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of</hi> Zion, <hi>they were like them that dream,</hi> Pſal. 126.1. They could ſcarce believe their own Senſes and Underſtandings in the Matter. Even ſo it is with many poor, melancholly, doubting Chriſtians; they <hi>deſire</hi> to be ſincere, but <hi>fear</hi> that they are not ſo: And thoſe Evidences of true Grace which to <hi>another</hi> would be diſcernable, to <hi>them</hi> are not ſo. Now, I ſay, tho ſuch Perſons be ſafe in the Hands of Chriſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Doubts and Jealouſies concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo their miſtake cannot prove <hi>deſtructive,</hi> as in the former Caſe: Yet it is of conſequence <hi>ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> both in point of <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>Comfort.

               <p>In a word, intenſneſs of thought is needful in this work, that ſo nothing may eſcape your obſervation, which might any way conduce to clear up the Point in Hand.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">1. Underſtand aright what you are to enquire after, leſt ye <hi>miſtake</hi> the Queſtion.

               </p>
               <p>If ye only enquire, whether there be any good in you which hath a tendency towards this great work of Regeneration, ye then fall <hi>ſhort</hi> in the Point; for I have told you before, that there may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep <hi>Convictions</hi> of the neceſſity of this renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Change, yea and ſome ſaint <hi>Eſſays, Reſolutions,</hi> or <hi>Endeavours</hi> towards it, which are only the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>common</hi> Grace, and if they be reſted in, do as certainly end in Deſtruction, as down right Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does.</p>
               <p>Again, there are various Degrees and Meaſures of Grace among the People of God themſelves: All that are ſincere are not of the ſame <hi>ſtature</hi> or <hi>ſtanding;</hi> ſome have received more Talents, a greater ſtock of Grace than others. If therefore ye enquire immediatly whether ye have attained to ſuch or ſuch Meaſures, to which ſome others (who perhaps are above you) have arrived, ye then lay a Snare for your own Comfort and Peace by carrying the Queſtion too high <hi>at firſt.</hi> Your preſent Buſineſs is to examin whether your Graces be <hi>ſincire;</hi> as for the <hi>degres</hi> of them, let that be enquired into afterward.

It therefore much concerns you, to converſe much with the Holy Scriptures, and to underſtand the true <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe and meaning of them, <hi>which are able to make you wiſe to Salvation.</hi> From hence ye muſt take your Meaſures, in judging of the Sincerity of your Faith, Repentance, Love, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo ye may not take up with the empty <hi>Name</hi> of Grace, inſtead of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf, as too many through Sloth and affected Ignorance do.</p>
               <p>And here ye muſt remember, <hi>that the Commandment of God is exceeding broad,</hi> extending not only to the

Nor would any have been more forward in <hi>ſo</hi> profeſſing, than thoſe very Perſons to whom our Lord ſpeaks, John 5 42. <hi>I know you, that ye have not the Love of God in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me therefore help you to find out the Truth of your Caſe, by the following Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Queſtion 1. <hi>How do ye reliſh the notion of an Happineſs which conſiſts in the enjoyment of God?</hi> I beſeech you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64915:61"/>deal truly and faithfully with your Souls in this; put it cloſe and home to your own Conſciences: Conſider it well before ye anſwer it: 'Tis likely, by this time, ye may have learn'd to ſay that there is no other Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs comparable to this; and that 'tis the enjoyment of God which makes Heaven to be Heaven! and it may be your Underſtandings are in ſome meaſure convinced of the Truth of what ye ſay, (or elſe I am ſure a great deal of pains has been taken with you to little purpoſe.) But for all that, I muſt tell you, the Queſtion is not yet half anſwered, the main Point is yet behind; the great work of Regeneration lies principally in the WILL. Search therefore a little further, ye may chance to find that your Hearts are more deceitful in this matter than ye thought of; examin <hi>narrowly</hi> how <hi>they</hi> ſtand affected. Right Notions are far more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the World (as dark as it is) than anſwerable Affections and Tendencies of Soul are.</p>
               <p>Come then, let us go a little deeper into the Caſe. Ye ſay ye believe there is no Happineſs to be compared with the enjoyment of God: But do ye <hi>feel</hi> what ye ſay? Are your Hearts moving towards this Happineſs? Lord, I have heard, and believe that thou haſt purpoſed to make thy People bleſſed in the enjoyment of thy ſelf; 'tis this that my panting Soul breaths after: I plainly feel that nothing elſe will content me; grant me this, and I have all; I can have no <hi>greater,</hi> I deſire no <hi>other</hi> Bleſſedneſs: Lord, may I but know thee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and love thee more, even as much as my Nature is capable of, and enjoy the everlaſting Senſe of thy Love in a ſtate of perfect Holineſs and Purity, I have then enough, I deſire no more; whatever elſe goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Happineſs in the World, is but an empty Notion; thou, O Lord, are my Portion, my All. If theſe or ſuch like Requeſts be <hi>really</hi> expreſſive of the <hi>inward, deep, habitual</hi> workings of your Souls, ye may then boldly conclude that God will not fruſtrate nor diſappoint ſuch Deſires as theſe which his holy Spirit hath kindled in you. Thoſe, who thus eſteem
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64915:61"/>and long for the Heavenly Felicity, ſhall have it: <hi>Hold on therefore to the end, he is faithful that hath promiſed:</hi> If it be thus with you, I tell you, ye are ſafe.</p>
               <p>But on the other Hand; if when ye hear mention made of ſuch a Happineſs, ye do, upon deep and impartial ſearch, find no ſutableneſs in the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Tendencies</hi> of your Souls, no Deſires after it, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather a ſecret <hi>recoiling</hi> and <hi>drawing</hi> back from it; if, I ſay, the caſe be ſo with you, methinks, I need not tell you ye are not like to be happy in that to which your Hearts are ſo diſaffected. Is not this plain enough? How ſhall I make it plainer? The Lord help you to underſtand and conſider it: I know carnal Minds are very ſtupid and blockiſh as to the apprehenſion of ſuch things as theſe. Let me try a-little further if I can drive it into you.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe God ſhould ſay to you, as once he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 3.5 <hi>Ask what I ſhall give thee.</hi> What ſhall I do for thee to make thee happy? Ask freely, ſpeak thy Mind, let me hear what thou wouldeſt chuſe for thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Why, here I ſay, if thou canſt form to thy ſelf any other notion of Happineſs that thou wouldſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe than <hi>that</hi> whereof we have been ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> which conſiſts in the enjoyment of God: I tell thee thou art in a woful caſe. Acts 8.22.23. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy Wickedn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs; and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy Heart may be forgiven thee. For I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe thou mightſt enjoy perfect bodily Health, and fulneſs of worldly Proſperity and Eaſe, and this for ever: If, I ſay, thou couldſt be content with <hi>this</hi> for thy Portion; to deal plainly with thee, thou are a graceleſs wicked Wretch.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64915:63"/>lo, this was the wonderful condeſcending way which God was pleaſed to make choice of, therein to ſhew us his amiable Goodneſs; that hereby our aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him might be healed. Could Men or Angels have thought of ſuch a Contrivance as this; or if they had, durſt they have mention'd it? But <hi>God's thoughts are not as ours.</hi> O the depths of his Wiſdom! How will theſe things tranſport us when we come to Heaven!</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that believe, Chriſt is precious;</hi> Is he ſo to you? Are ye willing to take up your Croſs and follow him? to give up your ſelves ſincerely to him? Is there any thing which you think too dear to part with if he call for it, nay, tho it were Life it ſelf? Know ye not that every true Chriſtian is in <hi>diſpoſition</hi> a Martyr?

               <p>O how is the caſe altered now! what would thoſe Chriſtians ſay if they ſaw us at this day? <hi>How much we mind our own things, and how little the things of Chriſt.</hi> Would they not think, either that Chriſtianity is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or rather that we ſcarce deſerve to be called Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>How are ye diſpoſed to ſpiritual Exerciſes? What delight do ye take in drawing nigh to God?</hi> All Creatures act according to their ſeveral Natures, 'tis pleaſant and agreeable to them ſo to do: If therefore ye have a new Nature in you, a Principle of divine ſpiritual Life, ye will thereby be enclined to holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; ye will move as it were <hi>Naturally</hi> towards them;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64915:63"/>ye will be ſerious and ſervent in them; and that for holy Purpoſes and Ends.</p>
               <p>That empty ſhew of Religion, whereby Hypocrites profane holy things, and deceive their own Souls, is a vain lifeleſs formal thing, a meer piece of <hi>Pageantry;</hi> they neither well know <hi>what</hi> they are doing, nor <hi>why</hi> they do it: 'Tis rather <hi>forc'd</hi> than <hi>natural, cuſtomary</hi> than <hi>conſciencious.</hi> No wonder if ſuch be ſoon weary of Duty, as being Strangers to the ſweetneſs of it! Job. 27.10. <hi>Will he</hi> (namely the Hypocrite) <hi>delight himſelf in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, a truly Religious Perſon acts in theſe Matters at another rate. He believes that <hi>God is, and that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> Yea, that he himſelf will be their <hi>exceeding great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> And this it is that ſuch a Soul longs after; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving choſen God for his Portion; therefore he reckons that a day employ'd in the Service of God is better than a thouſand elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Holy Souls experience that their ſpiritual Strength is renewed by waiting upon God; that their Graces are increaſed by exerciſe; that their Souls are cleanſed and purified, their Corruptions mortified and ſubdued; and in a word, that the holy Worſhip of the moſt holy God helps to make them more like him: And in all this they find thoſe inward reliſhes of Delight and Pleaſure, whereby they are fully convinced, that it is no leſs their priviledg and advantage that they <hi>may,</hi> than their Duty that they <hi>muſt</hi> attend upon God. They had rather he cut ſhort as to their daily Bread, than denied the liberty of approaching the Throne of Grace. In ſhort, they have Meat to eat which the World knows not of. Thus their Principles incline them to ſutable Operations, their Habits to Acts.</p>
               <p>If therefore ye find no inclination to Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but can without any regret let ſuch Opportunities over ſlip you, having no Delight nor Pleaſure in them: But think, if ye durſt, ye could live well enough without them.

               <p>The Hearts of wicked Men riſe againſt thoſe who are more ſtrict and ſerious than themſelves. They can hardly afford them a good Word or Look; but put <hi>Nick-Names</hi> upon them, and could wiſh they were rooted out of the Earth. Others there are, who, tho not ſo deſperately malignant, do yet think that leſs Care and Strictneſs might ſerve the turn, and are offended to ſee them make ſo much ado about Religion. But all thoſe who truly love God, love his holy Image where-ever they can diſcern it, love thoſe that are begotten of him, love thoſe that love him, <hi>as ſuch.</hi> So that Love to the People of God, is <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> referred unto God himſelf, who is loved <hi>in them,</hi> and they <hi>for his ſake.</hi>

Thus, chap. 5.2. <hi>By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God and keep his Commandments.</hi> So then, love to the Brethren is a more <hi>remote</hi> mark of Sincerity, and muſt it ſelf be tried

I ſuppoſe ye will readily grant that God muſt be loved better than your Neighbours, and yet they muſt be loved as your ſelves; therefore God muſt be loved better than your ſelves too. Thus the <hi>neceſſita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What I have to ſay in anſwer to this, ſhall be digeſted into the following Particulars, with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis very odd and dangerous to ſay, that that Man is in a State of Grace, who loveth not God as God; doth not this ſound very abſurdly and ſtrangely? We will leave it to the Ear, which, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſays, <hi>tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Words,</hi> Job 34.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis clearer by far than the Sun at Noon-day, that God, as God, is infinitely better than our ſelves, and the whole Creation beſides. I would not ſo much <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue</hi> your Judgments as to think, that ye ſtand in need of having this <hi>pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed</hi> to you: Nor would I ſo far <hi>overv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue</hi> your Piety, as to think that there is no need of <hi>preſſing</hi> it upon you, that your Hearts may be ſutably affected with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore we love not God, as God, if we love him not better than our ſelves, or our own Intereſt and Happineſs, as ſuch: Becauſe, as God, he is infinitely better than we are, or can be. God is the <hi>univerſal Self originated, independent, unchangeable GOOD;</hi> but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64915:67"/>the goodneſs of the Creatures is <hi>particular, limited, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,</hi> and entirely <hi>dependant</hi> upon him: And therefore by no means to be ſet in <hi>competition</hi> with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis certain that God hath deeply implanted in our Natures a Principle of Self-Love: And that he makes uſe of it, both in order to our Preſervation and Government. This it is which engageth us in the uſe of Means in order to our own Welfare, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in all the Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings that are ſet before us. This Principle neither <hi>can,</hi> nor <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>extirpated,</hi> but it muſt be <hi>regulated,</hi> and kept within its due Bounds, or in its proper Place, in order to the beſt and higheſt Ends.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis alſo evident that by the Apoſtacy our Self-Love is become inordinate, perverſe, and therefore exceeding ſinful: So that Self-denial is one of the firſt ſteps towards our Recovery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24.</p>
               <p>We are fallen from God to our ſelves, and are for ſetting up our own little, carnal, ſupported Self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in oppoſition to that full and proper Intereſt that he has in us: that is, we would be Gods to our ſelves; this is the grand fundamental diſorder of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Heart of the Old Man. This has disjointed us, and rendred us offenſive to God, and uneaſy to our ſelves, and to all about us, till we be reduced and ſet right again.</p>
               <p>So then this ſenſual corrupt Self-Love muſt be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; but lawful and juſt Self-Love muſt be improved, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In aſſigning the Notion of our chief or ultimate End, God's Glory and our own Salvation muſt not be ſeparated: For our intention muſt take in both; but then the latter muſt be conſidered as in full Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the former. We may and ought to deſire our own Eternal Happineſs, that God may be glorified therein, who is well pleaſed and delighted in the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Perfection of his holy ones. Our ſupreme
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64915:68"/>End muſt fall in with <hi>his,</hi> who made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he alone may have the Glory.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore to love God only or chiefly for our ſelves, as a means to our own Happineſs, is greatly to affront and diſhonour him, by preferring our ſelves before him, the Creature before the Creator, the ſilly Intereſt of a crawling Worm, before the glorious <hi>all-comprehending</hi> Intereſt of the ſupreme infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. 'Tis to invert the order of things, while we make our ſelves the end, and conſider him but as a means in order thereto: As if we were better, or more amiable than he; or our Happineſs more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than his Glory. Such Profaneneſs is not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, but abhorred. Know ye not that the whole Creation has no worth in it but what is derived from God, and to be meaſured by its Relation to him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To love God with a pure, raiſed, tranſcendent, ſuperlative Love for himſelf, as the moſt amiable and perfect Good, <hi>from, by,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> whom we and all things elſe are: And then to love our ſelves and all other Objects for him, as the ſupreme ultimate End of all; this is the true Method of holy Love, towards greater Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures whereof the beſt of us ſhould be ever aſpiring. Is it not highly reaſonable that he who is beſt ſhould be moſt loved? That he who is the Author of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould be our End? That we ſhould aim at and intend him in all; in a word that the love of our ſelves ſhould be ſubjected to the higheſt and pureſt Love of God? Urge theſe things upon your ſelves, take pains with your own Hearts to bring them to ſuch a Frame; plead the Cauſe of God with your Souls, till the Fire kindle, and ye be carried up above Self, to Him, and all by the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, he needs not you, nor your Love, <hi>neither can ye be profitable to him thereby, Job</hi> 22.2, 3. <hi>Your Goodneſs extendeth not to him.</hi> Pſal. 16.2. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is like to be your own, and ſhould not the Glory be his? As carnal inordinate <hi>ſelf-ſeeking</hi> is no better than <hi>ſelf-deſtroying:</hi> So, to go our of our ſelves, and

               <p n="9">9 But here it muſt be remembred, that God being immaterial and inviſible, is not an Object of Senſe, nor <hi>directly</hi> of ſenſitive paſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nate Love. Therefore the Heart may be <hi>inwardly, deeply, predominantly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſincerely</hi> for God, tho as to the <hi>paſſionate</hi> part, we may find our ſelves more ſenſibly carried out towards other Objects. Becauſe the nearneſs and ſenſibleneſs of the Creature promoteth ſuch ſenſible workings in the lower ſenſitive Faculties, and corporeal Spirits. As for example:</p>
               <p>A ſincere Chriſtian may be more <hi>feelingly</hi> affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a dear Friend or Relation, or ſome other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyment, than towards God himſelf; yet doth it not therefore follow that his Heart is more for theſe things than for God, becauſe were he put to trial, he would forſake all theſe Enjoyments, rather than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God or quit his Intereſt in him, whereby it appears that his Mind and Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l are more for God, tho the lower ſenſitive Appetite work moſt <hi>feelingly</hi> toward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Therefore tho it be eſſential to Holineſs to love God for himſelf, as our abſolutely ultimate End, and therefore better than our ſelves; yet there may be ſome ſecret conception or beginning of this Love in a Soul long before the Perſon in whom it is perceives it. Becauſe we are apt to judg of our ſelves by what appears moſt ſenſibly in us, and to overlook what lies more deep and inward. Now, as was ſaid before, love to ſelf, and to the Creatures, operates in a more ſenſible,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64915:69"/>paſſionate feeling manner, than holy intellectual Love doth. Becauſe God, being a Spirit, is not ſo near to our Senſes and Paſſions as the Creature is.</p>
               <p>Therefore, becauſe I would not <hi>make ſad the Hearts of any whom God would not have made ſad,</hi> Ezek. 13.22. nor give an advantage to Satan, to diſquiet the Soul of the weakeſt ſincere Chriſtian: Let me ſay to ſuch, as follows;</p>
               <p>Suppoſing that ye are ſatisfied that God, as God, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more amiable than your ſelves, and that he is your <hi>abſolutely ſupreme, chief</hi> or <hi>ultimate</hi> End; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ye ought to love him, as ſuch, above your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Again, if ye do earneſtly deſire that Happineſs which conſiſts in ſo loving him above any other Happineſs whatſoever: Tho in the mean time ye dare not ſay that ye love God for himſelf, above your ſelves; but are, it may be, more ſenſibly and feelingly concerned for your own Welfare, that ye may eſcape the Wrath to come, than for his Glory. Yet ye he wail this, and deſire an Heart to love God more for himſelf: And to refer your own Intereſt and all to him.</p>
               <p>Why, if the Caſe be thus with you, I would not have ye be diſcouraged, or caſt down: For it ſeems to me, that ye have the <hi>ſeeds</hi> and <hi>beginnings</hi> of this holy Love to God for himſelf, whereof we have been ſpeaking: And our Lord will not <hi>break the bruiſed Reed,</hi> nor <hi>quench the ſmoaking Flax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me therefore earneſtly beſeech you to pray hard for further Influences of the Spirit of Love; and take pains with your own Hearts to raiſe them more above ſelf unto God, that your Spark may become a Flame, and that ye may be even ſwallowed up of holy Love: So will ye find that Comfort, Peace, and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which ye are ſo penſively ſeeking and enquiring after. O learn at length to pore <hi>leſs</hi> upon your own poor, dark, drooping Souls, and look <hi>more</hi> at him who is LIGHT, and in whom there is no Darkneſs at all.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:64915:69"/>
               <p>As for the common ſort of the ignorant Pretenders to the Love of God and Holineſs, all this will ſeem to them more ado than needs. Nor is it difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their Pretences without going thus high.</p>
               <p>To theſe I would ſay: If (as ye profeſs) ye truly love God, whence is that ye think no more of him? And that ye ſpeak no more of him? And delight no more in converſe with him? Are no more concerned when he is diſhonoured? Nor grieved for your own Sins, and the Sins of others againſt him? How comes it to paſs that ſo many Religious Duties are wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by you? And others ſo miſerably trifled in, and ſlubber'd over? Whence is it that your Luſts are ſo much indulged, and that ye keep in league with his Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Is this the Love ye ſpeak of? It might well become you to know your ſelves better.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Uſe of Examination.</p>

               <p>And now I proceed to the Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To thoſe who are yet in an unregenerate State.</p>
               <p>Come, come, beſtir your ſelves; what have ye been doing all this while? what are ye dreaming of? It is high time to awake out of ſleep, and to haſten your eſcape from the Wrath to come, while there is yet Hope. Little know ye but your Glaſs may be almoſt run, and yet alas your great Work is undone. Let me ſay to you, as Gen. 19.17. <hi>Eſcape for your Lives, look not behind you, leſt ye be conſumed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore, ye would be converted and ſaved, let me alſo preſs upon you the following Directions.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:64915:70"/>
               <p>O Lord my God, I beſeech thee ſend me good ſpeed this day; and grant that the ſtrong holds of Satan may be broken; and the Intereſt of thy Son, my Lord, be advanced, and that the Kingdom of Glory may be haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened: Lord remember the Requeſts (tho too <hi>few,</hi> and <hi>cold</hi>) that have been put up to Heaven both in publick and in ſecret on this behalf, and give a gracious Anſwer.

                  </gap>tified and ſaved without any Endeavours of your own in order thereto? Or is it likely your Endeavours ſhould be to any purpoſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your Minds be firſt awakened, to proceed ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Matter? To ask your ſelves what ye are? Whence ye came? Where ye are placed? Whither ye are going? What ye have to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o? Try to anſwer theſe things to your ſelves. I muſt not ſtay to enlarge upon them: Do not expect to become Religious by <hi>chance,</hi> it muſt be by <hi>choice</hi> (through Grace) or not at all. And is it likely that the Will ſhould act blindly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64915:71"/>in the Caſe, or chuſe the Ways of God, before the Underſtanding be convinced of the Worth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of them? And what Conviction without Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration?</p>
               <p>I thought I had told you before, that God works upon Men as rational Creatures, upon the Will by the Mediation of the Underſtanding: But 'tis the deſign of Satan to keep you aſleep in carnal Security, to find your Thoughts <hi>other</hi> employment, that he may divert you from conſidering theſe things, for which your Reaſon was <hi>principally</hi> given you: And are ye willing thus to be led blindfold to Hell? (Lord, open their Eves that they may ſee): O think how ye will ever be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to God or your own Conſciences, that ye have been ſo ſtupidly inconſiderate, as to the things of your everlaſting Peace? All Wickedneſs may be reſolved into Inconſiderateneſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>My People doth not conſider.</hi> Ah ſinful Nation! a People laden with Iniquity.</p>
               <p>Well then, Sirs, if ye think your Souls worth ſo much Labour, I would offer to you ſome Particulars to be conſidered in the following order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider well how ſinful and miſerable an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate State is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the ſinfulneſs of it.</hi> It is a State of Hoſtility againſt Heaven. In Scripture account all unregenerate Men are Enemies to God, yea Enmity it ſelf. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. They are ſaid to contemn him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him, and to caſt him behind their back: They kick againſt him, they hate and abhor him, <hi>Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h.</hi> 11.8. <hi>My Soul loathed them, and their Soul alſo abhorred me.</hi> Is not this, think you, a ſinful State indeed? And is it not in ſome reſpect ſo much the worſe, in that they profeſs or pretend to the contrary? With their Mouth they ſhew much Love: but in reality, they do alienate themſelves from him who has the moſt full and abſolute propriety in them. They rebel againſt their moſt Righteous Governour; and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſe the Riches of his Mercy and Goodneſs.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64915:71"/>They tread under-foot the Son of God, and will not that he ſhould reign over them, and therefore are juſtly accounted Enemies; and muſt expect to be treated accordingly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me. They do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. And in all this they prefidiouſly break their baptiſmal Covenant, wherein they were ſolemnly devoted to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. And withal they wilfully deſtroy themſelves, and wrong their own Souls. But that brings me to the other Conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An unregenerate State is a miſerable State.</hi> How ſhould it he otherwiſe? Can a Man harden himſelf againſt God and proſper? No, no: Such Perſons are under the Wrath and Indignation of the Almighty, an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him; he is of purer Eyes than to behold them. His holy Law is armed with moſt dreadful Curſes, and Threatnings againſt them. <hi>God ſhall wound the Head of his Enemies; and the hairy Scalp of ſuch a one as goeth on ſtill in his Treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſal. 68.21. They are Slaves of Satan, led Captive by him at his Will, who employs them <hi>in treaſuring up unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath:</hi> Even the Offers of Goſpel-Grace which are daily made to them, as they aggravate their Sin, will alſo make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation heavier. Thus that which was deſigned for their Good, becomes the <hi>ſavour of Death unto Death unto them.</hi> What ſhall I ſay? They are Heirs of Hell, condemned already in Point of Law; tho Judgment has not yet paſſed the final Sentence: They are not ſure of being ſpared an hour longer. One would think this ſhould make them ill at eaſe, till the Affairs of their Souls be in a better poſture.</p>
               <p>'Tis wonderful to think what ſhift they make to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Anticipations of Hell in their own Breaſts. Put all this together, and then tell me whether it be not a miſerable State. Pſal. 50.22. <hi>Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64915:72"/>

               <p>Your times are not in your own Hands, ye know not how ſoon your Souls may be required of you; the longer ye delay, the more difficult it is like to be; and the Spirit that ſhould help you, will be grieved by your backwardneſs: Satan will have the faſter hold of you; and if Death overtake you before the work be done, ye are damned.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I ſay, turn your Thoughts which way you will, all other Reſolutions will be found mad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, except that of the Prodigal; <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father:</hi> So do ye. And here let me tell you 'tis needful that your Reſolutions be <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſteady,</hi> leſt thoſe Difficulties which may afterwards ariſe in your way ſhould diſcourage you; and that they be <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> leſt Death overtake you unprepared. And alſo that in this whole buſineſs ye be ſenſible of your own Weakneſs and Inſufficiency, leſt ye miſcarry through fooliſh Self-Confidence. But of that more by and by.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. See that your Reſolutions be forthwith put into <hi>practice.</hi> By this it muſt appear that <hi>they</hi> are true and hearty; if the VVill be determined in the caſe, ſutable Endeavours will enſue.</p>
               <p>And here your work lies in the following Order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humble your ſelves deeply in the Preſence of God for all that Sin and Folly which hitherto ye have been guilty of. Conſider the Evil of Sin as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy and pure Nature and Law of God. Call to remembrance your own Sins, and lay them to Heart, that they may not be laid to your Charge. In a particular manner bewail the Corruption of your Natures; and more eſpecially <hi>the eſtrangedneſs of your Hearts from God, and Enmity againſt him, with that inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate propenſion to the Creature,</hi> in which the Heart of the Old Man doth mainly conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Proceed then to conſider thoſe actual Tranſgreſſions which have all along iſſued from this Corruption, <hi>viz.</hi> Your loſs of precious Time, miſimprovement of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinances and Means of Grace; your Pride, Paſſion, Earthlineſs, Senſuality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Confeſs theſe things humbly and feelingly in the Preſence of God: Labour to melt into an ingenuous Child-like Sorrow, for having carried it ſo unworthily to ſo good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Father.</p>
               <p>That Sorrow for Sin which proceeds only from fear of Puniſhment, is the Sorrow of a Slave, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with as much Love to Sin as ever: But Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is animated by holy Love to God, which raiſeth in the Soul a rational hearty Grief for its Tranſgreſſions againſt him, an hatred of Sin, and Reſolution againſt it for the future. This is <hi>Repentance from dead Works, and toward God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that covereth his Sins, ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Prov. 28.13 Yea, as Matters now ſtand (ſuch is the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condeſcenſion of the Law of Grace) 'tis an Act of Juſtice and Faithfulneſs, as well as Mercy to forgive.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64915:77"/>Sin whereſoever with true Repentance it is confeſſed. 1 Joh. 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I ſay, give Glory to God, by an humble acknowledgment of your Sins. Lay your ſelves low, that his Glory may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e advanced: Put your Mouths in the Duſt, if ſo be there may be hope. Juſtify his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law, tho in ſo doing ye condemn your ſelves. Say with the returning Prodigal, Luk. 15.21. <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thankfully acknowledg the Riches of Free-Grace, in that God is <hi>yet</hi> pleaſed to offer you Terms of Reconciliation and Peace. The Golden Scepter is held forth to you that ye may touch it and live. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this ſhould encourage you, and put Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour into your Proceedings, and draw out your very Souls in ſweet Returns of Love to God. Lord, is there yet Hope; is there any Mercy for ſuch an one as I? Behold I come in Obedience to thy Call. <hi>Bleſſed be God for Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Humbly implore pardoning Mercy for your paſt Sins, and the help of Divine Grace for your preſent and future Duty. As the neceſſity of your Caſe ſhould make you very earneſt and importunate in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: So ye have great encouragement given you to ſtrengthen your Faith and Confidence in the Divine Goodneſs. <hi>God delights in Mercy, and hath proclaimed his gracious Name,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 9. Uſe this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Prayer, as the Pſalmiſt did, Pſal. 25.11. <hi>For thy Names ſake, O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity, for it is great.</hi> Plead the Merits and Satisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and aſſure your ſelves God is as ready to forgive, as ye are to repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your Sins. <hi>He will not deſpiſe a broken and a contrite Heart,</hi> Pſal. 51.17.</p>
               <p>And ſince the work that lies before you is holy and ſpiritual, therefore truſt not to your own Reſolutions or Strength: Pray hard for the help of the Spirit: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64915:78"/>your Souls open to the Influences of his Grace; yield your ſelves to his Conduct. Carefully ſtrike in with all his Motions. <hi>Lord, here am I, what wouldſt thou have, me to do? Teach me the way wherein I ſhould go, incline mine Heart to thy Teſtimonies, ſtrengthen me with Might in my inward Man. Magnify thy Power in my Weakneſs. Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth, draw me, and I will run after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And now give up your ſelves unfeignedly to God in and through Chriſt. If ye expect he ſhould be your God, that is, your Portion, Happineſs, Soul-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Good, ye muſt be his People, devoted to his Love and Service: The Covenant muſt be mutual, elſe how ſhould it be a Covenant. Let this be done with great Freedom, Chearfulneſs and Reſolution of Spirit, ye will never have reaſon to repent of your choice. <hi>He will be your Shield, and your exceeding great Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Live henceforth as becomes the Covenant-People of God. Renounce your Luſts and Corruptions: Let the time paſt of your Lives ſuffice you to have fulfilled the Inclinations of the Fleſh. Remember ye muſt now live at another rate than heretofore ye have done. The Glory of God muſt be your great End; his holy Word your Rule; his bleſſed Spirit your Leader and Guide; His Promiſes your Support and Joy. In ſhort, <hi>ye muſt become a peculiar People, zealous of good Works:</hi> Still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make further advances in the Knowledg and Love of God, and in Obedience to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Arm your ſelves, and watch carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Temptations to which young Converts are in an eſpecial manner liable.</p>
               <p>Under this Head I muſt only give you ſome ſhort Hints, for to ſpeak fully to this Point, would require a very large Diſcourſe. At firſt ſetting out ye enter upon a State of Warfare, and if ye ſtand not upon your Guard, Satan will be ſure to get an advantage againſt you,</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:64915:78"/>
               <p n="1">1. Some Perſons at their firſt Converſion meet with extraordinary Raptures of Spiritual Joy, full Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Love of God, and lively Foretaſts of the Heavenly Glory. Their reconciled Father ſmiles upon them, takes them into his Arms and comforteth them, <hi>as one whom his Mother comforteth, and dandleth upon her Knees,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.12, 13.</p>
               <p>And now Satan takes an advantage to make them impatient of ſtaying upon Earth any longer; they would needs be removed to Heaven out of hand, and are ſcarce content to wait God's time. This caſe, tho not very common, is yet more than a meet Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. To ſuch I would ſay,</p>
               <p>Ye have great reaſon indeed to be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that Matters are ſo well with you in reference to your eternal State. But O remember how long God waited to be gracious to you; how frequent were the ſtrivings of his Spirit with you before ye would yield! How well contented could ye have been to have continued on Earth for ever, before he gave you theſe feeling Diſcoveries of a better State! And how juſtly might he have left you to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in your Averſion from him!</p>
               <p>But now ye think your own turn is ſerved, and your eternal Welfare ſecured, ye would quit the Stage, and do no more Service for God, or his Church, in your Generation, but have your full Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs immediately, as if it were of Debt and not of Grace. Is this your Kindneſs to your Friend, your Ingenuity, your Gratitude? Is not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſure? Shall it not come in ſeaſon? Will not Heaven be the more welcome after ye have duly wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till ye be at age for that Inheritance? Is there nothing of Unbelief in this your eagerneſs? <hi>He that believeth ſhall not make haſle,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Had not the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their time of waiting as well as you? Is not ſo glorious a State worth waiting for? And beſides, if you <hi>patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in well-doing,</hi> your Glory will be encreaſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider ye have nothing but what ye have received, and <hi>why then ſhould ye glory as if ye had not received it?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. Ye have received nothing but what ye muſt give an account for. Your ſtock of Grace is to be traded with, your Talents muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; what reaſon then have ye to tremble leſt in this ye ſhould be found wanting? Moreover, ye bear not the Root, but the Root beareth you; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt ye can do nothing, <hi>be not high minded, but fear. Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed liſt be fall.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12. Spiritual Pride is the way to loſe what ye have got, and to full into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Devil. Beſides, there is a great deal of Abſurdity and Self-contradiction in it; <hi>viz.</hi> for a Man to have high thoughts of himſelf, as if he had attained unto great Meaſures of Grace, when the entertaining of ſuch Thoughts is a ſign that he has little true Grace, if any at all. Deep Waters and full Veſſels make leaſt noiſe; the moſt fruitful Ears of Corn hang downwards; not ſo, thoſe that are ſhallow, empty, or blaſted.</p>

Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how great a ſtreſs the Goſpel lays upon ſervent Charity; loving one another, is the Note or Mark whereby we muſt be known to be Chriſt's Diſciples. The grand eſſential Points of Religion, which ye muſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64915:79"/>live upon, are generally owned, and acknowledged by all Parties: Is it not then a great piece of Folly (tho very common) to over-look theſe weightier Matters, and to ſuffer our Zeal to evaporate and ſpend it ſelf about Wood, Hay, and Stubble? Of this ſee my Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Immortality of the Soul. Pag.</hi> 143. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater your Hopes of Heaven are, ſo much the more reaſon ye have to be watchful againſt Sin, diligent and active in the way of your Duty: But if ye grow negligent or remiſs in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ye have cauſe enough to ſuſpect that your Hopes and Confidence are ill-grounded, or not like to laſt long. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Every Man that hath this hope in him, purifies himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; there are many Eyes upon you: The great God is the moſt reverend Witneſs of all your Thoughts, Words, and Actions: The Angels of God encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs you about, and obſerve your Behaviour: Satan waits to take you at an advantage; your fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are concerned for your Welfare and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Wicked Men wait for your halting. Surely this is not a time for you to be ſlothful or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Moreover; ſuppoſe you be in a State of Grace: many that have been ſo have fallen into very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sins, and wounded Conſcience deeply; and your Safety depends upon the continual Influences of the Holy Spirit: and therefore it muſt needs be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to grieve or quench that Spirit, by Lazineſs or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security.</p>

Gird up the Loins of your Minds; ſighing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining rid no Buſineſs: Set your ſelves to the work with all your might. Admit that you have not yet ſincerely cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis not too late to do it now; and it is a thing that muſt be done, or you are undone forever. But if you ſuppoſe or hope you have done it already, it will be ſo much the eaſier to do it again; nor will it be loſt labour to renew your Covenant with him: The advantage is great every way. If your Souls be habitually for Chriſt, draw out thoſe Habits into exerciſe, and that is the way to feel that you have them: Thus Grace will be more diſcernable, and Conſcience more quiet, while you are intent upon your Duty. You may be ſaved though you ſhould live and die under great Doubts and Fears as to your ſincerity, but you cannot be ſaved except you <hi>be</hi> ſincere. Therefore, obſerve, it much more concerns you to enquire <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> than How ſhall I know that I ſhall be ſaved? And indeed this is the moſt likely way to get aſſurance, or however ſuch neceſſary ſupport as may keep you from ſinking. It is one thing to have Grace; another thing to know that ye have: The former is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, the latter is not ſo.</p>

               <p>Moreover, Little things are not eaſily diſcerned, a little Faith, Love, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (tho ſincere) are not ſo ſoon diſcovered: Therefore, I ſay again, take pains with your own Hearts to bring them nearer to Chriſt, labour to be carried out towards him with a more full bent and reſolution of Soul, even ſuch as may clearly turn the Scale for him againſt all other Intereſts whatſoever; and this is the moſt dutiful, ſafe and ready way to know that you are ſincere. Strong Grace will ſpeak for it ſelf. Children and weak Perſons are apt to be peeviſh and full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but with thoſe that are more healthy and vigorous it is not ſo. Well then, either you are <hi>now</hi> willing to comply with the Offers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or not; if not, 'tis a ſign you are yet in your Sins, and that this great Change has not yet paſſed upon you: But if you be willing, know that the Law of Grace is as much in force as ever; and therefore 'tis both your Duty and Intereſt to give up your ſelves to Chriſt, as tho you never had done it before. And this is the true way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and diſcover any Sparks of Grace in you, which at preſent lie hid under many Doubts and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. Caſt your ſelves at the Feet of Chriſt, open your Caſe to him: Lord, I have a treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deceitful Heart, I know not how to truſt it, I dare not ſay that I have as yet heartily accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thee as thou art offered in the Goſpel, but ſince thou art ſtill pleaſed to renew the Offer; Lord, I deſire from the botrom of my Soul, to do it now: O do thou <hi>keep this in the imagination of the Thoughts of my Heart, and prepare my Heart into thee.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.18.</p>

Surely the nearer you get to God in the exerciſe of Love and Praiſe, the more your Clouds and Doubts will vaniſh; the remembrance of Mercy and Kindneſs received is in its own Nature pleaſant and refreſhing to the Soul: And the more you own him, the more Light and Comfort you may expect from him.

It much concerns you that your ends and aims be rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ſettled in this Matter; Carnal ſelf too oft intrudes into, and ſo corrupts our Deſires even after ſpiritual things. VVatch your Hearts narrowly here, 'tis ten to one but you find them very faulty. Our own VVelfare and Peace may indeed be aimed at, but in full Subordination to the Divine Glory. VVhat is the intereſt of a VVorm, to the honour and intereſt of the great God? How can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to proſper while Self is ſo much look'd at, and God ſo little? Know ye not that even your Souls themſelves, and all their Hopes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, muſt be entirely ſubmitted to his all-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Intereſt? VVell then, let me ask you, what is it that makes you ſo deſirous after Aſſurance? Is it only that you may be more ſafe, or that you may be more ſerviceable? That your Minds may be more quiet, or that you may with more Heart and Vigour lay out your ſelves for God in-Praiſe, Thankfulneſs and Obedience? If it be the Honour of God that you deſign in it, know that he is glorified by the Humility, Self-reſignedneſs, Patience and Conſtancy of his Servants, even when they are under great Doubts and Fears, and this he expects from you as moſt ſutable to your preſent Circumſtances. You muſt not expect all plain way; God is wont to make Men feel the bitterneſs of their former Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and to lay them low in Self-abhorrence, before he build them high in Comfort and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He delights in glorifying his Grace and

Theſe are no ſure Marks to judg of your State by: Becauſe they ebb and flow variouſly according to the Temper and Diſpoſition of our natural animal Spirits. Tho lively Affections in Duty are very deſirable, and ſhould be endeavoured after; yet in trying our ſpiritual Eſtate, the inward deep rational workings of our Souls towards God are mainly to be look'd at, <hi>viz.</hi> a fixed and high eſtimation of him above all in our Underſtandings, and hearty Reſolution for him, and cleaving to him in our Wills, with correſpondent Endeavours to pleaſe him and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, through the whole courſe of our Lives: In theſe things it is that the Life of Grace and Duty doth conſiſt.

'Tis true indeed, we are not to run upon Sufferings till God call us thereto; but if it pleaſe him ſo to do, we ought thankfully to accept of ſuch a Call, as a Prize put into our Hands for the exerciſe of our Graces, and the advancement of our Comforts. But on the other Hand, if you be for taking up with a cheap and eaſy Religion, and excuſing your ſelves from the more difficult ſelf-denying Parts of Duty, it is a ſign your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but weak at beſt, and therefore your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are not like to be ſtrong.

               <p>'Tis certain that none have a Right to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, but thoſe who comply with the Terms of that Covenant. Nor can any have the Comforts of Aſſurance, who do not know that they have ſo complied. Now 'tis the Spirit that enables us to aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, and particularly to the Truth of the Promiſes that are made to ſincere Believers: And it is he that inclines our Hearts by his Grace to accept of the Benefits offered, and to perform the Duties required; that is, truly to repent of our Sins, and to give up our ſelves to God in Chriſt: And when we have ſo done, our Caſe is ſafe. But in order to the comfort of Aſſurance, 'tis further requiſite to diſcern our own ſincerity in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-cloſure; and from thence to conclude that we are in a juſtified State; and have a Right to the heavenly Felicity. Now here we ſtand in need of further help from the Spirit, that we may

We muſt be able to <hi>give a reaſon of the Hope that is in us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. So doth the Apoſtle here in the words of the Text.</p>

               <p>Under this Head you may obſerve the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Carry on a continual Warfare againſt your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Corruptions; the Fleſh will be luſting againſt the Spirit, ſo long as we are here on Earth. Labour therefore to keep under the Body, and to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection. Do not indulge your corrupt carnal Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, how agreeable ſoever to your Conſtitutions or worldly Intereſt. Have a care of being in love with fleſhly Proſperity and Eaſe. Search after thoſe Sins which do moſt eaſily beſet you, thoſe Corruptions which do moſt frequently foil you, and ſingle them out to run them down: Spare them not, but deal with them as <hi>Samuel</hi> with <hi>Agag, hew them in pieces before the Lord.</hi> Fortify your ſelves with Arguments againſt them: keep a ſtrict watch, go not to the utmoſt extent of your Chriſtian Liberty; reſiſt the firſt ſtirrings of them, the leaſt tendencies towards them. Prov. 30.32. <hi>If thou haſt done fooliſhly in lifting up thy ſelf, or if thou haſt thought evil, lay thine Hand upon thy Mouth.</hi> Avoid as much as poſſible the occaſions of Sin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of your beloved Sins: Habituate your ſelves to frequent ſerious Thoughts of the Preſence of God. <hi>Set the Lord always before you,</hi> Pſal. 16.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Make not a light Matter of the leaſt decays in Grace, or Tendencies toward backſliding. What tho it ſhould be granted that a regenerate Perſon cannot (or rather ſhall not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.) fall away finally; yet it is paſt all Doubt that ſuch an one may fall very fouly, ſo as to grieve the Holy Spirit, to wound his own Conſcience, to blemiſh his Profeſſion, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure his Evidences: 'And is not all this ſad enough?</p>
               <p>Moreover; 'tis certain Men uſually decline by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and therefore the leaſt Degrees or Tendencies thereto are not to be ſlighted.</p>
               <p>If therefore you find that Conſcience begins to grow leſs tender than formerly it was; if Sin ſit lighter, and the ſenſe of remaining Corruption is leſs grievous to you than heretofore; If you grow more cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64915:92"/>and careleſs in religious Duties, and leſs regardful to keep up the Life of holy Communion with God in Chriſt: If you can more eaſily let ſlip ſpiritual Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and find leſs reliſh and ſweetneſs in them than formerly; if the Intereſt of the the World and Fleſh begin to grow more prevalent with you, and you are ready to phancy that 'tis good to be here, while in the mean time your Thoughts of Heaven grow cold and languid, and your Deſires or Longings to be with Chriſt do abate: If you find it thus with you, you had need beſtir your ſelves in good earneſt to recover your firſt Love, and to ſtrengthen the things which remain, and are ready to die. Otherwiſe you little know how far the Spirit of God may be provoked, and what conſiderable Degrees both of Grace and Comfort may quickly be loſt. I need not tell you that Satan will do his worſt to hinder you in your way to Heaven; your own Corruptions, and the Snares of the World will get Ground upon you: You had need row hard againſt the Stream, which of it ſelf will carry you back, if you preſs not forward. <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Labour to exerciſe each Grace and Duty in its proper Order and Place, ſo that one may not interfere with, nor exclude another. See that your Judgments be well ſettled as to the great Principles of Religion, that your belief of them be firm, deep and ſolid.

Eſpecially that the Glory of God be firſt and laſt in all your deſires, higheſt in your eſteem; and all things elſe deſired in full Subſerviency thereto. Here lies the Life of Religion, and this we ſhould be ſtill contending and ſtriving to raiſe our Hearts more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that they may move more naturally; eaſily, and delightfully therein; that God's Intereſt may be of all others the neareſt and deareſt to us.</p>
               <p>And then for the direction of your Practice, labour to underſtand the true ſenſe and extent of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, to ſee the Amiableneſs, Righteouſneſs and Perfection of the Divine Law, that you may heartily approve thereof, love it, and live accordingly. <hi>Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Law of God, after the inner Man,</hi> Rom. 7.22.</p>
               <p>The whole Frame of Chriſtian Principles, Graces and Duties, is beyond meaſure lovely, in the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous connexion of the ſeveral parts thereof. Labour therefore that this Frame may be more and more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted upon your Hearts, and expreſſed in your Lives, <hi>That ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing,</hi> Jam. 1.4. If you be maimed in one part, all the reſt will fare the worſe for that. Remember, Integrity is the Glory of a Chriſtian; <hi>viz.</hi> that no part be lacking. 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> That is, let us ſee that no part of Holineſs be wanting in us, and that we be not wanting to any part of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſtill preſſing forward towards Perfection even in degrees.</p>
               <p>Take care, for example, that your Zeal be guided by Knowledg, leſt it ſet all on Fire, and prove miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to your ſelves and others, or at beſt no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an <hi>Ignis fatuus.</hi> And again, let your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg be improved into holy Zeal and Fervency, that you be not luke-warm or indifferent in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which moſt juſtly challenge our whole Hearts. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64915:93"/>Humiliation for Sin be ſo exerciſed, as not to exclude humble Confidence in the Mercy of God, ſpiritual Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if God give you a large ſhare of Aſſurance and Comfort; do not therefore think your ſelves above the fore-mentioned humbling Exerciſes; which will be a means to preſerve your Purity and Peace.</p>
               <p>Moreover, let not the Duties of the firſt and ſecond Table juſtle out each other, but let both be duly and carefully obſerved in the ſeveral Branches of them. Think it not enough to be juſt and upright, or (as they call it) morally honeſt in your dealings with Men, except you be alſo ſerious, hearty, and ſincere in the Service of God, and in the devotedneſs of your Souls to him. And again, think not that any Worſhip of Service you perform to God will be accepted, while ſecond-Table-duties are wilfully neglected. It is the deſign of Religion to make us better and more uſeful in every Relation and Capacity wherein we ſtand. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16, 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2.12.

The actuating of holy Deſires, and preſenting them to God, muſt needs tend in its own Nature to ſtrengthen thoſe Habits of Grace from which ſuch Deſires proceed. Beſides, as it is the performance of an undeniable Duty, (ſhould not a People ſeek unto their God?) a moſt reaſonable piece of Service, ſo an anſwerable Bleſſing may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected upon it. <hi>God is the Rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeek him.</hi>

                  <hi>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. Ask for great things, and with great Earneſtneſs; come not with mean poor narrow thoughts of the Divine Goodneſs; be not cold nor lazy in your Requeſts. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Mat. 5.</p>
               <p>A learned Divine mentions ſecret Prayer in the fore-front of thoſe Duties to which our Souls are naturally moſt backward. [Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Now one would think our own Neceſſities ſhould even conſtrain us to it. Alas, how ſhould we live without it! and how much doth it concern us to ſtrive againſt our Indiſpoſition to it! How ſweet is a Duty when reſcued out of the Hands of Difficulties!</p>
               <p>O Sirs! whence is it that God hears no oftner from us, and with no greater fervency? Surely frequent and earneſt Approaches to the moſt holy God would be a great means to make us more like him.</p>
               <p>Remember, God has ways enow to bring you to your Knees. What if dark Clouds ſhould ariſe upon you, or ſome ſharp Affliction befal you? then 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64915:94"/>you would come crying after him, and <hi>ſeek him early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. But why not without ſo much ado? why ſhould not gentler Methods prevail with you? Be but acquainted with your own Hearts, and you need not want either Matter or Motives for this great Duty. Never expect to grow in Grace, without keeping up Life and Fervency in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to ſhut up this Head, with a Paſſage which I lately met with in the Life of the Excellent Mr. <hi>Philip Henry.</hi> To the Publiſher whereof I here return my moſt humble Thanks. 'Tis as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;</p>

Apoſtacy generally begins at the Cloſer-door, ſecret Prayer is firſt neglected and careleſsly performed, then frequently omitted, and after a while wholly caſt off; and then farewel God, and Chriſt, and all Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Learn the Art of holy Meditation. 'Tis by this that we draw in Life, Strength and Sweetneſs from thoſe great Goſpel-Truths, which inconſiderate Perſons lay by as if they were dead or uſeleſs things. 'Tis this that enlargeth our Knowledg and clears our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in ſpiritual Matters, and ſets on work our Reſolutions, Affections, and all the Faculties and Powers of our Souls; 'tis a Soul-improving Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Nor can you want Matter for ſuch Meditation, if you will but ſee your Thoughts at work, and keep them cloſe to it.</p>
               <p>Meditate upon the glorious Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the bleſſed God, his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Holineſs, Truth, All-ſufficiency: Think I ſay on theſe, and think again, till becoming Impreſſions be wrought upon your own Spirits, <hi>changing you from Glory to Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. Think not upon God in a ſlighty or ordinary manner, but with the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Admiration, leſt you take his Name in vain, whereof you may be guilty in thought as well
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64915:94"/>as in words. Let every Thought of God be mighty upon you, and participate in ſome ſutable Meaſure of the greatneſs of its Almighty Object.</p>
               <p>Think much on your bleſſed Redeemer, who he was, what he did, what he ſuffered, and why, as alſo what he has further promiſed to do. Thus let Chriſt dwell in your Hearts.</p>
               <p>Think on the Holy Spirit of Grace, call to mind his Influences and Operations upon your Souls, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely you are obliged to him, how much you have ſtill to do with him. How direct and explicite you ought to be in your actings of Faith upon him, as well as upon the Father and the Son. And how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful you ſhould be to carry becomingly towards him.</p>
               <p>Think on the Holineſs, Purity and Perfection of the Divine Law, how ſweet, how reaſonable, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous that Obedience is which God has required of us. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it is my Meditation all the Day,</hi> Pſal. 119.97.</p>
               <p>Think on the Heavenly Perfection, what the Saints in Glory, and the bleſſed Angels are doing, what they are enjoying, till your Souls be on the Wing, longing to be joined to that holy and happy Society.</p>
               <p>Think on the Graces wherein you are moſt defective, conſider the reaſonableneſs and neceſſity of them, and how ill you can live without them, or without greater degrees of them. Plead the cauſe of every Grace with your own Hearts, and in the midſt of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations lift up your Eyes and your Souls to Heaven for help therein. O that you would be perſwaded to try this Courſe, to engage your ſelves in the frequent and ſolemn Exerciſe of this great Duty of Meditation: the advantage would be great every way. And that you may be the fitter for this more ſtated Exerciſe of Meditation, it will be very uſeful, in the midſt of your Employments and Buſineſs in the World, to be often ſending up a Thought or Ejaculation towards Heaven.</p>

As the Goodneſs of God abounds toward you, you muſt endeavour to abound in the Work of the Lord; that ſo it may appear, <hi>that the Grace beſtowed upon you is not in vain,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10.58. Surely 'tis fit God ſhould have the Glory of his own Gifts, while you have the benefit and comfort of them. This is the way to receive more, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sit down and conſider ſeriouſly, caſt about in your Minds, what ſhall I do to promote the Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that God, who has done ſo much for me? Can you form no Project for greater ſervicableneſs? I will try if I can help you by and by; in the mean time reſolve to walk with God more humbly, ſtrictly and watchfully than ever yet you have done: and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to embrace every opportunity which it ſhall pleaſe God to put into your Hands, to teſtify your Thankfulneſs by humble and ſelf-denying Obedience. 'Tis true God needs not you, you cannot be profitable unto him: But it is as true that he expects all this from you, as a due Expreſſion of the Gratitude and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of an honeſt Heart. Tho you cannot profit him, yet obedient you muſt be; and beſides Soveraign Authority, you have many indearing Obligations thereto. I will ſhew you preſently that you need not want work, but will endeavour firſt to fortify you againſt the difficulties of it.</p>

               <p>We muſt expect to meet with many Afflictions,

Whether they be ſuch as come more immediately from the Hand of God: <hi>Shall we not be ſubject to the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and live?</hi> Heb. 12.9. <hi>q. d.</hi> We muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, our Lives lie on it. To mutiny is mortal; as one gloſſes upon the place. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems good in his Eyes. When God is glorifying himſelf in correcting us, we muſt with <hi>Aaron</hi> hold our Peace. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. Be ſtill, and know that he is God: Dumb, and not open our Mouths, becauſe he does it.</p>
               <p>If we be afflicted by the Pride or Malice of Men, here again we have need of Patience, that we fret not our ſelves becauſe of Evil-doers; nor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any peeviſh revengful Thoughts againſt them. There's more of Chriſtianity in this than moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors think of. To be habitually diſpoſed, <hi>to bleſs thoſe that curſe us, and to overcome Evil with Good.</hi> And indeed we ſhall never be able to bear the <hi>Contradiction of Sinners,</hi> without fainting in our Minds, except we exerciſe Patience, and eye the Example of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3.</p>
               <p>Again; are we aſſaulted by the Temptations of Satan? we ſhall never conquer without Patience.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we have need of Patience to carry us through the religious Duties to which we are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called.

Striving to help on others, will be a means to exerciſe, and increaſe your own Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to advance your Comforts: It will be a ſign that you love Chriſt ſincerely, when you lay out your ſelves to promote his Intereſt. And ſince God hath had Compaſſion upon you, ought ye not to have ſome Compaſſion upon your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. I know the Devil will do his utmoſt to oppoſe you, but you muſt be armed with Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Patience. <hi>There are more with you than againſt you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you meet with any that are buffeted with Temptations, perplex'd with Doubts and Fears; remember it might have been your own Caſe. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therefore to adminiſter Comfort to them, by religious Conference, Communication of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and all other proper Means that fall in your way; do not deſpiſe the meaneſt of them.</p>
               <p>And then, as for thoſe that are in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State; how can you look upon them, and not be deeply concerned for them? The leſs they pity themſelves, the greater objects of your pity: If the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were obliged to be kind to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64915:96"/>and not to vex or oppreſs them, becauſe they themſelves had been ſuch in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore <hi>knew the Heart of a Stranger, Exod.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 34. O then what reaſon have you to pity thoſe that are in an unconverted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, eſtranged from God! It was once your own Caſe, you cannot but know what a dead, dark, diſaffected thing the Heart of ſuch a Perſon is; how obdurate and ſenſeleſs. O think what they are doing, and whither they are going, if infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy do not prevent. Happy you, if you can help to ſave one Soul from Hell! But let me urge this Point ſomewhat more diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Begin with thoſe that are under your ſpecial Care and Charge: If theſe periſh through your neglect, look you to it, their Blood will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your Hands. Thoſe of you that have Families, think how much you have to do for God in them. It may be ſome of you will ſay, we keep up religious Exerciſes in our Houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Praying, Reading the Scriptures, and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Praiſes of God. I anſwer, thus far is well, I wiſh more could ſay ſo too: But this is not all that you have to do; Children and Servants are to be dealt with plainly, familiarly, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, by you, with all the Skill and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you can in order to the Salvation of their Souls. I muſt not ſtay to give you particular Directions, honeſt Hearts and a ſincere deſire to do their Souls good, will ſoon put you in a way to do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have a great deal to do for the Souls of your Neighbours. Are not many of them ignorant, carnal and ungodly? Can you contrive no way to be helpful to them? Have you no particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in ſome of them? Have they no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon you? Are they under no ſpecial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to you? Why are not all theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages improved for God? Can you ſee them periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64915:97"/>by Multitudes round about you, and not once open your Mouths to help them? Is this to love your Neighbours as your ſelves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. In a word, I tell you, 'tis your duty to take all opportunities, wherever you come, or with whomſoever you converſe, to do good to Souls. I do not mean that ſacred Things ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by raſhneſs, indiſcretion or imprudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, nor Pearls caſt before Swine, who will turn again and rent you: But one thing I will tell you, as bad as the World is, the Names of Holineſs, Juſtice, Purity, Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſtill honourable among Men, and the contrary Vices are accounted odious: No Man would be look'd upon as an impious, profane, unrighteous Villian. Now this gives you ſome advantage; and a willing Mind may find many ooportunities to bring in good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that in ſuch a way as the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt of Men ſhould ſcarce dare to contradict it. There is ſomewhat in ſerious Religion which commands Awe and Reverence, even from them that hate it. <hi>Herod feared John the Baptiſt, knowing that he was a juſt Man and an holy,</hi> Mark. 6.20. As for thoſe that are civilized or moralized (as ſome ſpeak) the difficulty is next to nothing, to bring in ſome edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Diſcourſe among them, and to leave ſome good ſavour behind you. (Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>the Salt of the Earth,</hi> Mat. 5.13.) And to let them know that the Life of Religion is ſomewhat more than they ſeem to place it in. Can you not gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prudently reprove the Sins of others, where you think it may do good? I know that this is a Duty that goes as much againſt the Grain as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any; but the Scripture is plain, Lev. 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine Heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin to the upon him.</hi> Or, as the words may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered [that thou bear not Sin for him] you make your ſelves Partakers with other Men in their Sins,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64915:97"/>if you endeavour not to prevent them. In ſhort, God will own thoſe that own him, and ſtand up for his Cauſe; and if that be not enough, ſee where you can find a better Patron.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as for thoſe that are poor and low in the World, you might make way for doing good to their Souls, by ſhewing Kindneſs to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if you thought it worth the while to be at any expence for the intereſt of Chriſt in the World. I ſay no more than this, if it were poſſible that Grief could have any place in Heaven, this ſure would be the matter of it; to remember how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we had done for God on Earth.</p>

You may feaſt your Souls upon the Proviſions which Chriſt hath made for your preſent ſupport, and more eſpecially upon thoſe diſcoveries which he has given you of the Glory intended for you; and you have need ſo to do, leſt you faint by the way.

Were our Hearts more ſet upon Heaven, it would put Life and Savour into all our Duties, it would ſupport us under Afflictions, and enable us to baffle Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; it would be an Evidence of our Sincerity, and raiſe us above the ſlaviſh Fears of Death. But I proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be much in the exerciſe of a lively well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hope. Faith preſents the heavenly Glory to the view of the Soul, Deſire reacheth forth towards it, Hope lays hold upon it.
